[mjschultz][1], a user on the popular news sharing site Reddit, that happens to have a pretty great little St. Louis section, decided to put together a handy little iCal Calendar for easy importing in to whatever it is you use (Google Calendar, Apple iCal, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your 5 year old flip phone</span>) so you won&#8217;t miss any of the cool stuff that goes down in Forest Park.

> I&#8217;m not sure how many people are interested in this, but I&#8217;ve made an iCal calendar file from the official list of [events][2] in [Forest Park][3]. It isn&#8217;t perfect, but neither is the input file. So you can use either the [iCal Calendar File][4] [or the] [RSS Feed][5]

Great work on a fantastic idea!

&#8230;we noticed that the calendar is missing the &#8220;running of the bums that ask joggers for spare change despite the fact that no one that jogs carries any money on them&#8221; but we&#8217;re not picky since that isn&#8217;t an &#8220;official&#8221; event.
