Now her furlough is over, but for a second there it looked like we were going to be seeing the &#8220;[Insert activity here] on my furlough.&#8221; for everything she broadcast to Twitter last week.

Seems odd to be broadcasting the fact your company sent you home with no pay for a week.  Looking for a new job Kay?

&#8230;also, I know  you can find a better photo than that for your Twitter picture!  Just snap off a couple of shots on set tonight, you are definitely looking better than this old headshot these days!
