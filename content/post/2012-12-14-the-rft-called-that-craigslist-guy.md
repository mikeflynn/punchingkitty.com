Earlier this week <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/12/10/a-st-louis-guy-just-looking-for-his-personal-secretary-to-have-sex-with/" target="_blank">we were the first to bring you the story about a local man looking for a live-in secretary</a> who will pick up his kid from school, be &#8220;semi professional&#8221; and &#8220;semi respectable&#8221; and enjoys his interest in &#8220;420&#8221;&#8230;oh and hopefully have sex with him.

> …yeah you’d hate to get someone that’s any more than “semi” respectable. It would totally ruin your whole business venture that is definitely not…unretarded.
> 
> Shut it down Craigslist. Never gonna get any better than this one.

<a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2012/12/craigslist_seeking_adverturous_woman_jim_midgett.php" target="_blank">Well Jessica Lussenhop of the RFT gave him a call!</a> We had no idea she wanted to leave the RFT, or be this guy&#8217;s sexy secretary, but good for her! Reach for the stars! (by &#8220;the stars&#8221;, we mean &#8220;his junk&#8221;)

> Does this pragmatic paramour know about his growing internet fame?
> 
> No, as a matter of fact, he did not. Until we called him.

Guess what his name is?! **Jim Midgett**! Please let his middle name be &#8220;mental&#8221;, please let his middle name be &#8220;mental&#8221;&#8230;

> When we caught up with Jim Midgett via phone, he&#8217;d just been reading some of the online chatter about him with his roommate.
> 
> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a clue at all. Actually, I&#8217;m not very computer savvy,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My feelings aren&#8217;t hurt at all about it.&#8221;

So how&#8217;s the ad going?

> Not everyone thinks this sounds nuts. In fact, he&#8217;s already had ten responses and three interviews.

Meth is a hell of a drug.
