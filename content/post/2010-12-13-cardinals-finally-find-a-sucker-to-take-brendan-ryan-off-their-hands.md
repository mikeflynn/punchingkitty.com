Derrick Goold from STLToday had <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_f0dee762-062b-11e0-b59c-0017a4a78c22.html" target="_blank">the announcement</a>:

> The club traded their incumbent starting shortstop to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for High-A righthanded starter **Maikel Cleto**. The club confirmed the move this afternoon with an announcement.
> 
> Ryan became expendable for the Cardinals after they acquired infielder **Ryan Theriot** from the Los Angeles Dodgers last month. Theriot was billed immediately as the Cardinals starting shortstop, and they let other teams know that Ryan was availble [sic].

Pretty much the moment the dissapointing 2010 season came to a close, the Cardinals have done everything to rid themselves of Brendan Ryan short of putting him on the steps of the Padres in a basket, ringing the bell and running. They searched and searched for a new starting shortstop and then decided that they couldn&#8217;t afford a good one, settling with the scrappy Ryan Theriot. Moments after that accquistion, the Cardinals spent most of their time telling everyone that Theriot was starting shortstop and Ryan was a big douche that no one wanted to play with and they really needed to get rid of him. A clever gambit by the Cardinals to publicly disparage the player they were trying to unload in order to get as little return as possible worked out, netting **Maikel Cleto** from the Mariners.

> Cleto, 21, went 4-9 with a 6.16 ERA in 23 appearances (21 of which were starts) with a career-high 83 strikeouts in 102 1/3 innings for the Mariners advanced-A affiliate. Cleto went on to start at the Arizona Fall League, where he went 2-1 with a 7.91 ERA in six starts.

&#8230;but apparently he can throw hard, so that&#8217;s something.

> “I’m excited to go where I’m wanted,” Ryan told <a href="http://www.foxsportsmidwest.com/12/12/10/Cardinals-send-Ryan-to-Mariners/landing.html?blockID=371636&feedID=3713" target="_blank">FOXSportsMidwest.com</a>

Pretty safe to say that Brendan Ryan can now be listed in the &#8220;F*ck You Cardinals&#8221; list after having Tony LaRussa and General Manager John Mozeliak effectively create the MLB-version of a Craiglist ad with price of &#8220;Bag of balls or you&#8217;re best offer.&#8221; joining big names like Scott Rolen, Jim Edmonds and Woody Williams along with small names like John Rodriguez.

Despite Ryan&#8217;s obvious claim to the &#8220;woe is me&#8221; title in all of this, the person we&#8217;re saddest for is Fox Sports Midwest baseball scribe **B.J. Rains** who spent the majority of this calendar year getting quotes from Ryan and then tweeting them ad nauseam. In just the last 6 hours (of this writing) <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=14122327864246272&page=1&q=+ryan+from:bjrains" target="_blank">Rains had dropped nearly 20 tweets</a> about the departing shortstop.

Hang in there B.J.! We&#8217;ll keep our fingers crossed for you in the hopes that the Cardinals pick up someone later this off-season that will talk to you.
