_**Update:** Hey look, what do you know! This shooting was because of an argument about the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/12/19/man-gets-mad-in-barber-shop-shoots-toward-patron/" target="_blank">according to the AP</a>. A shooting because of an argument about a shooting? USA! USA!_

_Original post below&#8230;_

A man entered the &#8220;All Cuts Barber Shop&#8221; in Wentzville, MO yesterday, apparently had an altercation with someone inside, left and returned a moment later to shoot the place up.

Do they not get the news in Wentzville? We&#8217;re all kinda anti-bringing guns places these days.

> The suspect was a regular at the shop and, according to another customer, was a “really great guy.”

The shooters are always &#8220;great guys&#8221;, because if someone that knew him told a reporter that the suspect was &#8220;A pretty f\*cked up dude. I definitely figured he&#8217;d shoot a building up one day.&#8221; people would think that guy was a dick for not telling anyone until now. Also, f\*cked up guys, doing f*cked up stuff isn&#8217;t news, because that happens quite a bit. It&#8217;s definitely news when a &#8220;quiet genius who always kept to himself&#8221; does it though.

> Officers were alert and responded to the scene. The suspect was captured and a gun was recovered from his vehicle.

> The victim was not hurt, but the bullets left several holes in the wall and floor.

We&#8217;re going to take a shot in the dark and say the floor in the &#8220;All Cuts Barber Shop&#8221; in Wentzville wasn&#8217;t all that nice, so this is the best case senario. Still, you kinda want to see this guy&#8217;s haircut don&#8217;t you?
