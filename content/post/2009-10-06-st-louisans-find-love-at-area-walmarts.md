One quick look through missed connections on Craigslist found **18** attempts to reconnect that person they felt an instant connection through the crowds of blue vests and hairy-backed men in sleeveless shirts.

Here are our favorites:

> **Collinsville Walmart &#8211; m4w &#8211; 28 (collinsville)**
> 
> Saw you in Walmart this afternoon. We locked eyes as you were going into the checkout lane. I saw you again when you went to the customer service counter. Can&#8217;t get you out of my mind now! If you&#8217;d like to meet up later tonight or tomorrow for drinks, e-mail me back with what you were wearing or a picture.

&#8220;&#8230;or a picture&#8230;you know, if that&#8217;s easier.  I&#8217;m not creepy at all by the way.&#8221;  I always wonder what this type of guy&#8217;s definition of &#8220;locked eyes&#8221; is.

> **regarding the walmart self check girl &#8211; 25 (lake st. louis)**
> 
> i read this post
  
> and it warmed my soul,
  
> deep from within the cockals of my heart
  
> thank you to the brave soul
  
> who exposed a piece of his heart
  
> and shared it with all the world
> 
> [I see you all the time, but I don&#8217;t think you see me. ]
  
> [You are SO amazingly beautiful. And you have, by far, ]
  
> [the most astonishingly sexy ass of any woman I have ever seen. ]
  
> [Your ass is so incredible that it hurts&#8230; ]
  
> [I really wish I could do things to it, and to you&#8230;. ]
  
> [I always look forward to going to Walmart, and hoping you are there&#8230;. ]
  
> [so I can feast my eyes on your beauty and dream&#8230; ]
> 
> now thats a deep connection

If by &#8220;deep connection&#8221; you mean, &#8220;good way to get a restraining order&#8221; then yes, it is a deep connection.

> **Belleville Walmart &#8211; m4m (Belleville, IL)**
> 
> You were shopping at Walmart around 2:30 pm on Saturday (09/26). I noticed you looking at me so I kept circling in the area until you left. You were wearing a red t-shit, short and I believe you are from Germany. You are a very attractive young man and I would greatly enjoy the opportunity to get to know you. Not necessarily in a sexual way, but I would not be opposed to that either. I do hope that you see this and respond.

I mean not in a sexual way&#8230;unless  you think so too&#8230;then TOTALLY!

> **UPS guy Union Walmart &#8211; m4m &#8211; 41 (Union)**
> 
> Seen you at Union walmart tues evening.very sexy hot man. You, dark salt pepper hair 5 oclock shadow. left around same time, you got in blk chev truck. caught you eye, might of been nothin but if it was, hopefully you seen what i was wearing or what i bought, let me know if interested in a little relief sometime.very discreet here

That&#8217;s one way to get a _package_ delivered.

> **walmart in festus &#8211; m4w (festus)**
> 
> you were wearing black boots and a denim skirt and were HOT just wanted to tell ya OMG not many women look that good anymore

This guy&#8217;s approach is to insult every other woman in an attempt to get this one particular woman he saw in passing at a Walmart.  Great plan.

Did you find love at Walmart?  &#8230;or more likely, do you go to Walmart and feel the eyes of creepy hoosiers and barely there door greeters crawling all over you?
