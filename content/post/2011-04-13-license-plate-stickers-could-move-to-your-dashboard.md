Sure, most people are pissed, but not bleeding when they realize they&#8217;ve been victimized, so it&#8217;s not exactly at the top of everyone&#8217;s mind, but estimations are that the sticker theft costs the state of Missouri around $10 Million every year. That&#8217;s a lot. Like &#8220;turn out the lights and lets do this thing&#8230;no kissing though&#8221; a lot. Oh like you didn&#8217;t do stuff for money in college!

> Rep. Denison estimated more than 5,000 stickers were stolen, just from vehicles in the City of St. Louis in 2009;  3,000 in the Springfield area; tens of thousands state wide.  He said going to windshield stickers like New York and Texas, would  allow Missouri to recoup $10 &#8211; $12 million in registration fees and sales taxes that people avoid paying now by using stolen stickers.

> &#8220;They put them on the inside of the windshield (in Texas) and it stopped the theft,&#8221; he said.

Perfect! As everyone who&#8217;s parked downtown for any length of time at night knows, you definitely can&#8217;t break a windshield! You also can&#8217;t just use a tool like a razor blade to get at the precious stickers any more, you&#8217;ll need a more sophisticated and harder to find tool&#8230;like a rock.
