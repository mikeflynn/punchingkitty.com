Though we don&#8217;t know the specific figures being bounced around, the current subscription price for a full week&#8217;s paper (including the Sunday issue) is just under $18 a month.

In other news, The Globe Democrat started its controversial &#8220;Hey baby, I&#8217;ll let you do _anything_ for $10.&#8221; campaign today, underneath the Highway 40 overpass on Tucker.
