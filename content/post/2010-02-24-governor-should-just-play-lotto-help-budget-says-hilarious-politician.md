Man politicians are funny!  The state needs money and to help Governor Nixon with that number Rep. Mark Parkinson from St. Charles County has threw together a bill that says Nixon should be required to play Powerball in and effort to cover the cost.

> The bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Parkinson, R-St. Charles County, would deduct $2 from Nixon&#8217;s paycheck twice a month to buy Powerball lottery tickets and place any potential winnings in a fund called &#8220;Governor Nixon&#8217;s Scratch-off, Match-off Fund.&#8221;
> 
> The fund would be dissolved and moved into the general revenue fund if the governor&#8217;s potential winnings were to match or exceed $300 million &#8212; the exact amount in Nixon&#8217;s budget recommendation for fiscal year 2011 that comes from an extension of federal stabilization funds that has not yet been approved by Congress.

So Governor?  Thoughts?

> Nixon&#8217;s office said the bill is silly.
> 
> &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth commenting on,&#8221; Nixon spokesman Scott Holste said.

Oh man.  You are _so_ funny!  That was funny.  I mean you should be a comedian.  I bet you like Family Guy&#8230;its _so_ your humor!  Really funny.  I mean not as funny as not wasting our money, but really really funny.

Other proposed bills from Parkinson include &#8220;Bil 40283A: Please look at me to validate my life.&#8221;, &#8220;Yo Mamma so fat Fridays&#8221;, and a bill that states all retard fights are required to last a minimum of 10 minutes before attempting to break it up.  &#8230;actually we are totally for that last one.  Vote YES on Prop R!

To join the fight against actually funny jokes check out <a href="http://www.markparkinson.com/" target="_blank">Parkinson&#8217;s website</a> that where Mark cooly welcomes you to his site in a sport coat and asks that you join &#8220;Team Parkinson&#8221;.  Also make sure to checkout the confused baby and the scary immigration graphics on the right.  You know I hear after 5 Mexican move in to your neighborhood, you have to fly the American flag upside down below the Mexican flag.  True story.

[_Editor&#8217;s Note: Number of Parkinson&#8217;s (the disease) jokes or jokes referring to Michael J Fox: Zero.  That was tough._]
