KMOV is reporting that a sink hole forming in South City has been fixed, thus foiling the earth&#8217;s desire to suck the city of St. Louis back in to the earth so it can grow a bunch of flowers there instead&#8230;and maybe put up a Jamba Juice.

> Residents in the 5200 block of Parker and Fairview say it had been blocking their alley since February.  A St. Louis City Streets Department official says the broken sewer pipe underground should be fixed tomorrow.
> 
> The repairs will cost $1,500 and the alley should be open by the weekend.

&#8220;In hindsight we should have worked a little faster.&#8221; Mother Earth said in a statement, &#8220;but honestly, who would have guessed that the city would do a damn thing about this. I figured we had until at least July before they even noticed the west end of Tower Grove park was gone.&#8221;

When asked why the plot to take back St. Louis Earth replied &#8220;That &#8216;Knockout Game&#8217; bullshit mostly, but I&#8217;ll tell ya something, that whole &#8216;Lets all hang around and smoke in the front of the door at Quiktrip!&#8217; deal is crazy annoying. What&#8217;s wrong with you? You got your gas and your bag of chips, now go home! Plus we heard that the Rams might be leaving and that&#8217;s pretty much the last straw. You guys were this close to getting taken out when the Cardinals left for Arizona&#8230;that&#8217;s actually when we really started making sure your schools were crap, swallowing up the smart kids, so you couldn&#8217;t figure out how to stop us by now&#8230;but if you&#8217;re getting dumped by two crappy teams? Too much. It&#8217;s time we get that flower field and the Jamba Juice in here. Throw a few picnic benches out there, how nice would that be by the river? So nice!&#8221;
