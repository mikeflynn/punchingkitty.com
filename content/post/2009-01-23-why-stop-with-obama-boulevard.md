Everyone knows that St. Louis has a time machine and has found a way to predict out the next 4 to 8 years.  The results of their epic quest?  Obama will be the best black president USA has ever had!  So we&#8217;re naming a street after him!  Boosh!

But I say, why stop there?  There&#8217;s all kinds of other street blocks that could use some fancying up!  Here&#8217;s a few that we at PunchingKitty.com are pulling for:

  1. Roland Burris Ave
  2. Caroline Kennedy Cul de sac
  3. Spagnuolo Street
  4. Ram&#8217;s Super Bowl 2010 Blvd
  5. Ballpark Village Parkway

Yup, those all seem like sure bets to me.
