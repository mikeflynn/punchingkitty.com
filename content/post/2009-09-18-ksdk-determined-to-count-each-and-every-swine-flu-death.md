From [KSDK.com][1]:

> Missouri has recorded its second swine flu death, and the first in the western part of the state.
> 
> State health officials say a 24-year-old Independence woman died Wednesday night, several days after she was hospitalized with symptoms including diarrhea, coughing and extreme fatigue. Her name was not released.

Look, KSDK, I don&#8217;t know how to tell you this&#8230;geez&#8230;um, we don&#8217;t care about Swine Flu any more.  We&#8217;ve moved on to more important issues like Kanye West, so you should move on too.  Sure its kinda interesting that the Swine Flu symptoms seem to be exactly like what happens after caving and eating at Taco Bell, but do we really need to count each one?

Also, I went ahead and submitted this article to Fark from your site since there was a button there for it.  It may not do well though, its only kinda funny.
