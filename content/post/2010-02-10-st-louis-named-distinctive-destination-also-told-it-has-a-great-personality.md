Take that every other United States city list that always has St. Louis at either the bottom or at the top when the list starts with &#8220;Worst&#8230;&#8221;!  Someone just got named to the &#8220;Distinctive Distination&#8221; list!

> St. Louis was named among the 2010 Dozen Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) and could be named a “favorite” if the city garners enough online votes.
> 
> The NTHP has recognized, since 2000, cities and towns that offer “an authentic visitor experience,” according to the organization.
> 
> The NTHP refers to St. Louis as “one of America’s great cities,” pointing out that looking beyond the city’s hallmark offerings shows “a vibrant, ethnically diverse city full of unexpected treasures and one-of-a-kind attractions.”

Ya hear that?!  One of &#8220;America&#8217;s great cities&#8221; with &#8220;unexpected treasures and one-of-a-kind attractions&#8221; besides thats the city-version of how I would describe the hot girl&#8217;s fat friend to my buddy, thats pretty high praise!

What other major metropolitan cities are we next to in the list?  New York?  Chicago?  San Francisco? Pffft.  They wish. Baller cities like us roll with The Crooked Road, Va&#8230;.and Chestnut Hill, Pa&#8230;.or uh&#8230;Sitka, Alaska. God damnit!  What kind of crap list is this?!

We get the distinct feeling that Mayor Slay got us on this list along with a free tote bag after donating $500 to PBS.
