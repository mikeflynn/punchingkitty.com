Over the last weekend the national media descended on St. Louis for a chance to talk steroids with Tony LaRussa, Albert Pujols and of course Slightly-Less-Big Mac.

Pujols had some really nice supportive things to say about McGwire to the press, but we can&#8217;t shake this feeling that Pujols is a little confused about what Mark confessed too exactly&#8230;

Maybe not though.  McGwire did seem pretty happy dancing with those &#8220;Single Ladies&#8221; in that video.
