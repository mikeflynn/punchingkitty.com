It&#8217;s hot in St. Louis. Real hot. How hot? It&#8217;s so hot that:

* Forest Park has been renamed Savannah Park

* Talk 97.1 is airing a special on the dangers of Global Warming

* The Penguin & Puffin Coast attraction at the zoo is now a fried chicken stand

* The Blues just traded Erik Johnson for a lifeguard

* Mayor Slay just awarded Nelly the key to the city for his innovative plan &#8220;take off all yur clothes&#8221;

* The line at Ted Drewes is so long that&#8230; oh, wait, nothing&#8217;s changed there.

* St. Louis county is willing to merge back with the city in exchange for a bucket of ice.

* Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg just called back. They just mumbled &#8220;Uh, never mind&#8230; &#8221; and the phone went dead.

* &#8220;A Goddam Fan&#8221; just won the Democratic primary for Kit Bond&#8217;s senate seat.

* The Kings of Leon have a new song &#8220;Hot Pigeon Shit Blues&#8221;

* Busch stadium concession vendors now just pour the beer directly on your head.
