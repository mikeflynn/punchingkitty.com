So the word is that Bridgeton, Missouri smells horrible. Like if a monkey ate a bunch of rotten cheese, and then an elephant ate the monkey and it gave him diarrhea, which was put in a blender with some asparagus pee and poured in to Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s vagina&#8230;or something else that smells bad.

> Residents said the smell was horrid. There were some residents in St. Ann who said they could smell it too.
> 
> A KMOV 4 photographer went out to Bridgeton and he said the smell was so bad it made his eyes burn.

City officials checked every single area Rally&#8217;s to see if anyone had recently eaten there, thus triggering the stink, but no one had and so the mystery remained. There is one theory though&#8230;

> The source of the problem could come from the two landfills located in Bridgeton.  But this isn’t the first time a strange smell has been noticed by residents.
> 
> Back in October 2012, the Pattonville fire district said [trash] decomposing underground created heat and caused an odor.

Way back in October of 2012 huh? Well that was so long ago, who took those kind of concerns seriously? What&#8217;s the worst that could possibly happen with underground trash?

> They were worried it could reach radioactive waste buried nearby.

Oh sweet lord, we&#8217;ve created mutant trash stink! Why?! Why didn&#8217;t our forefathers listen back in October of 2012?! Damn you! Damn you all to hell!

> Bridgeton city leaders, police and firefights have not said if both odors are connected.

Bridgeton leaders went on to say, &#8220;No, no, this is just how it smells here at our house. You&#8217;re just not used to it, so it&#8217;s a little weird. Just give it a few hours.&#8221; Nice try, but he word is out and no one will be accepting any sleepover invites to Bridgeton any time soon. People will also probably start assuming Bridgeton is poor.
