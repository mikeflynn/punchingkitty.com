That guy is made of pure balls.

You would have to be to waltz in to a bank and rob the place looking like <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/?attachment_id=4634" target="_blank">Paul from Cheers</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_Cheers_characters#Paul_Krapence" target="_blank">huh?</a>), with nothing but a pursey-wallet-thing-but-definitely-nothing-a-man-shoudl -be-carrying-around thing in his hands.

Ok, a fat, bald, middle-aged white guy in a polo shirt and dress pants. He can&#8217;t be hard to find. We&#8217;ll stake out all area Lowe&#8217;s and you keep and eye on _everywhere_ in St. Charles County.

Good to see though that now the whities have a equivalent to the bastardly generic &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/12/14/nelly-robbed-black-guy-in-hooded-sweatshirt-crime-spree-continues/" target="_blank">skinny black guy</a> <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/12/10/woman-attacked-in-umsl-bathroom/" target="_blank">in a hoodie</a>&#8221; that keeps committing all those crimes.
