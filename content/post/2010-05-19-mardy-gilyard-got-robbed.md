> &#8220;I am OK. Just upset, you know, more than anything,&#8221; Gilyard said Tuesday from his Northern Kentucky home. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of living in the city. I know from my experiences in the city when it warms up &#8211; as soon as it warms up &#8211; the grimy cats in the city come out. I wasn&#8217;t paying attention to my surroundings as much as I should have been.&#8221;

Well that can happen. Sucks though especially since everything we&#8217;ve heard about Gilyard points to him being a great guy. Big draft pick like him should probably get a body guard.

> Two men armed with a gun approached Gilyard **and his bodyguard**, Terry Hobbs, and robbed them of $300 in cash and $1,000 in jewelry about 9:30 p.m., a police report shows. No injuries were reported.

Oh.

Maybe get a good body guard and not just the gentle giant you&#8217;ve known since middle school. What&#8217;s the point of a bodyguard if you can still get jacked in the street. Maybe it was more of a Ben Roethlisberger-style &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Think It&#8217;s Rape If You Hold Her Down For Me&#8221;Â kinda bodyguard? If it is, don&#8217;t waste your money Mardy, plenty of jersey-chasers around here.

We also really love that Gilyard lied to the mugger.

> &#8220;We see your chains! Give me your chains!&#8221; Gilyard recalled the robber yelling at him. The man also demanded the keys to Gilyard&#8217;s new car. Gilyard , who had the keys in his pants pocket, told him the car had a keyless ignition.

> &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;brother, I ain&#8217;t got the keys,&#8221; Gilyard recalled. &#8220;So then it was, &#8216;well, forget the keys! Give me the money! What about the money!&#8217; That&#8217;s when he put a .38 revolver in my face. I gave him the pocket change I had on me.&#8221;

Dumb ass mugger. Wait, crap. Here&#8217;s hoping he doesn&#8217;t read the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Good thing, if he&#8217;s already been getting jacked: Should fit in just fine here in St. Louis.
