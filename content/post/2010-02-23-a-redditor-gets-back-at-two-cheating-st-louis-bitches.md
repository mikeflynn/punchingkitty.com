> A young, college aged woman sits down by herself and orders a Bud Light at the two-top next to us.
> 
> Shortly after, her slightly older female friend joins her.
> 
> They begin loudly discussing the fact that the young lady JUST has cheated on her boyfriend at a party. The discussion is filled with information about the sexiness of it all, the temptation, and the desire to do it again and not be caught.
> 
> So I sit, and I continue listening, they were so loud, that you couldn&#8217;t ignore them&#8230;on and on about advice about phone records, not using texts, the mentality you need in a man to cheat with and not get caught&#8230;.on and on&#8230;.disgusting.

Ok, so these bitches should be drug out in to the street and shot&#8230;or at least be tied to chair and made to watch those Charles Barkley Taco Bell commercials over and over again.  Our hero had a different idea though&#8230;

> So I listen, and after a few minutes, the older woman says the magic words I needed to hear.
> 
> &#8220;Chris can never find out. It would kill him&#8221;
> 
> So now I have a name. Chris.
> 
> I don&#8217;t know Chris, by the way. But that&#8217;s no matter.
> 
> I pull over a chair to their two-top.
> 
> &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Burt. I thought I recognized you when you came in. How&#8217;s it going? I met you briefly through Chris.&#8221;
> 
> I then say: &#8220;I figured I&#8217;d come over and say Hi real quick, but seriously&#8230;and this is a bit odd&#8230;.but I heard everything you just said. I&#8217;m sickened, but I am going to let Chris know everything I just overheard. Small world isnt it?&#8221;
> 
> Both females turned bleach white, and the young cheater looked like she had just seen her parents die in a fiery crash.

Well played sir.  We here at Punching Kitty salute you!

Not only is that story great, but he&#8217;s making it public to try, though most likely in vein, to alert &#8220;Chris&#8221; about his <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/02/19/hoes-be-trippin-in-the-loop-yesterday/" target="_blank">hoe that be trippin&#8217;</a>.  Its a long shot, but its getting plenty of attention.  The post on Reddit about this has, as of this writing, 1,671 votes and 1,430 comments along with any attention h<a href="http://stlouis.craigslist.org/mis/1613010296.html" target="_blank">is cross post on Craigslist</a> had received.

Our advice to Chris?  If she&#8217;s really hot, get one more pitty F out of her and then get out of there buddy.

If anyone thinks they may know who Chris is, please <a rel="tip" href="#">tip us via the site </a>or the tip line: 314-266-TIPS
