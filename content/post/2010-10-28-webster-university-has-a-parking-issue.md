This photo of someone&#8217;s witty reply to Mr. Gottlieb&#8217;s parking fine threat has been making the rounds today.

Though according to the Webster University website there are 13 lots with various rules of who can park there and when, it&#8217;s not enough for some Webster students. One of them has a printer a couple thumb tacks and some free time.

Also of note on the <a href="http://www.webster.edu/about/policy/parking.shtml" target="_blank">Webster University Parking Policy</a> page is this little nugget:

> Donâ€™t know where to park? Call (314) 968-6900 and speak to the Department of Public Safety.

Operators are waiting for your call disgruntled Webster students!
