[_Editor&#8217;s Note: One more sports post today. Sorry non-sports fans, but I think at least this one will be entertaining to all of us that like to laugh at the stupid things people put on YouTube._]

Dammit [Obama Girl][1] and YouTube.  Now every somewhat famous face gets its own &#8220;girl.&#8221;  Don&#8217;t believe me?  Even Cardinals center fielder Colby Rasmus has one apparently.

&#8230;oh and this one&#8217;s not super talented with the singing or the dancing.  But hey, a crazy fan is a crazy fan right Colby?



Sadly, this video actually worked.  We hear that she got invited down to hang out with her lover-boy on the field towards the end of the season.

So, uh, where&#8217;s our &#8220;girl?&#8221;  Who wants to be the &#8220;Punching Kitty Girl?&#8221; &#8230;or rather, who already _is_?

Send us your submissions!  Oh and if there aren&#8217;t any girls that are down for this idea that read this, taking a video of your girlfriend while she sleeps, setting it to music, and sending it this way totally counts fellas.
