> McKernan said today that he got down on bended knee while the couple watched a perfect sunset on a beach in Sanibel. &#8220;That&#8217;s how it went down,&#8221; he added. Being a real gentleman, McKernan had already asked Mom and Dad Benassi (Susan and Terry) for a thumbs-up on his plan to propose.

Very sweet of McKernan to propose in Sanibel, FL rather than in the middle of the MGM Grand during a break in a poker tournament. What a great little story there Deb. How&#8217;d they meet?

> The couple met when Benassi came to work for insidestl.com.

Sounds about right. When the current marriage isn&#8217;t working out so well, time to hire ourselves a girlfriend! Being the boss is awesome!
