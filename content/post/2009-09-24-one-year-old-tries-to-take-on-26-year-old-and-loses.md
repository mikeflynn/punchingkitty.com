> Jefferson County Prosecutor Forrest Wegge has charged **Ronald Wills**, 26, of Arnold with felony assault and endangering the welfare of a child after he allegedly beat his girlfriend’s 1-year-old daughter.
> 
> The child’s mother left her child in Wills’ care on Aug. 22 to go to work. When she returned, she found her daughter had swelling on her face and head and that Wills was looking for an ice pack to treat her, according to court documents.

Yeah Wills knew he was kicking a baby&#8217;s ass!  That&#8217;s why he was looking for an ice pack.  You normally wouldn&#8217;t do that for a guy that stepped to you gotten beat down, but you know&#8230;he was a baby, so after your done giving the baby &#8220;two skull fractures, massive facial and head swelling and bruising as well as abdominal trauma&#8221; you get the little punk an ice pack.  Its only fair.

You&#8217;re a good guy Ronald Wills.  Your tough but fair _beating of a one year old baby_, shows the world how to handle little punks like that.  Move over Dr. Phil!
