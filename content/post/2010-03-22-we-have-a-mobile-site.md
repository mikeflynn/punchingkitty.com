So we hear these iPhone things are getting pretty popular, and its proven by our stats that say lots of you try to read this site with one. Just for you people (and you other crazy Blackberry and Android phone people too) Punching Kitty now has a nice format for mobile phones!

What do you need to do? Nothing! Â Just type in punchingkitty.com like normal and if you are on a iPhone (or whatever) the site will change to a nice, easily readable and browsable version.

Enjoy and feel free to let us know of any problems you have with it and if there is something that&#8217;s not there you want to see.
