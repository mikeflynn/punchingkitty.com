[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8272" title="jud_birza" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/12/jud_birza.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="283" />][1]We don&#8217;t watch Survivor because we don&#8217;t suck, but lots of other people do and a few of them told us that the student/male model on there, nicknamed &#8220;Fabio&#8221;, who won, happens to be from the St. Louis area.

> Pretty boy **Jud Birza**, better known to fans as Fabio, beat Chase Rice by one vote to take the title of Sole Survivor and the million-dollar prize. He also became the youngest player at age 21 to win the game. It was interesting that it came down to these two guys — Sash Lenahan didn&#8217;t get any love from the jury — because it almost seemed like a contest between dumb and dumber.

**Wentzville High School** must be proud to see on of their alumni strutting his stuff on TV while being unanimously labeled a moron by a nation! If he graduated from a St. Louis City school, sure&#8230;but a St. Charles County school district?! Say it ain&#8217;t so!

Judson &#8220;Jud&#8221; Birza, native of Lake St. Louis and part of the Wentzville High School graduating class of 2007, describes himself as &#8220;Intelligent, sexy and goofy&#8221; according to his <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/cast/21/jud" target="_blank">Survivor bio</a> and has carved out quite an interesting existence since leaving St. Louis. An existence that mainly consists of surfing, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=803&id=508002356" target="_blank">modeling for Abercrombie and Fitch</a>, being a member of the band &#8220;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Space-Funk-Odyssey/286930865532" target="_blank">Space Funk Odyssey</a>&#8220;, having <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3646024/" target="_blank">a sparse IMDB page</a> and recently, winning the 1 Million dollar Survivor prize.

Winning a million bucks (give or take..mainly give) from Survivor is certainly nothing to sneeze at and should buy this Missouri native more time to do whatever the hell he does with maybe a little extra to finally buy some shirts.

Expect **KMOV**, the local CBS affiliate, to drive the news of a guy that moved away from St. Louis when he graduated high school and won a reality show that is falling out of the collective American consciousness faster than a Howie Mandel, right in to the ground. Why wouldn&#8217;t they. It&#8217;s totally super mega monkey dragon huge news. Also it&#8217;s helps their copywriters out by being something different for a change. There&#8217;s only so many different ways you can jazz up &#8220;Guy Shot in St. Louis&#8221;
