> In 1997, Danny Ray Schwab was convicted of molesting 22 young boys and sentenced to 40 years in prison. His sentence was reduced about five years ago, because of what the St. Clair County State&#8217;s Attorney calls a &#8220;legislative error.&#8221; Now, Schwab could be out of prison as early as February 28, 2010.

Check out Danny there on the right.

It seems to me that the best way to catch all these molesters out there is to go to that horrible barber shop that all these guys go to for the &#8220;too-short in the front middle part&#8221; hair cut.  Just hang out front with a t-shirt and a beanie hat on and you&#8217;ll catch more molesters than a 6 year old covered in honey with other 6 year olds stuck to him.

Apparently there is some law that will make sure Danny dances alone in a treatment center.  So there you go.

Just in case though, have your kids watch this:
