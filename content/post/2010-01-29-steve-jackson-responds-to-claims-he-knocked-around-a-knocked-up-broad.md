Our thoughts? None of this crap is true.

First, beating the hell out of a pregnant girl is something thats so messed up that is usually comes out in the wash right away, not 10 months later.  Only furthering suspicions that this is all bull is the fact that he is already in a legal scrap with Harris about child support.  Sure would help her case if he looked like a pregnant girl beating meanie.

Lastly, wouldn&#8217;t this be something the police are interested?  We think so&#8230;except if there isn&#8217;t any evidence. Granted the Las Vegas police will probably open an investigation on this if it gets enough press because someone is always up for re-election, but if there was something real here, wouldn&#8217;t have there be work on this oh say, when it happened, not 10 months later?

Yes, if this is true, even a little bit, it would be bad for St. Louis and the Rams so I have a built-in slant. However, we have never heard even a single bad story about Steven Jackson so until some actual hard facts come to light we are on Team Jackson.

Also we hear that sometimes &#8220;bitches be trippin&#8217;!&#8221;
