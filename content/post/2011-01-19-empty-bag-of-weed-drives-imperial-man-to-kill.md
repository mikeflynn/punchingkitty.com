**Ryan Harris** (right) paid **Michael Maybearry** (dead) $20 for a bag of weed, got home, found the bag was empty. That made Harris angry, so angry the first thought through his mind, as told to police was: &#8220;I gotta kill this guy.&#8221; Harris sounds pretty highly strung. He _really_ could have used that weed!

> Harris allegedly fired two rounds through the back of Maybearry&#8217;s rear window as Maybearry drove away, and Harris drove after him. Once on southbound Old Highway 21, Harris pulled beside Maybearry and fired six rounds into the driver&#8217;s side as the cars were moving, court documents say.
> 
> Maybearry crashed into a ditch and hit a tree. Harris went to the car and found Maybearry inside groaning. Harris told investigators that he demanded his money back, but Maybearry said he couldn&#8217;t move.

&#8220;Dammit it dude! Give me my $20 dollars back!&#8221;

&#8220;Well ok. You just shot me and drove me off the road in to a ditch, so I&#8217;m having some trouble reaching my back pocket right now. Things hard enough to reach in your car even when you haven&#8217;t been shot and been in a wreck you know? Â Stupid jeans pockets. Am I right?! &#8230;anyway, I&#8217;m bleeding pretty bad here and it was just $20 bucks, so if you could just give me a hand&#8230;&#8221;

> Harris said Maybearry aggressively grabbed his wrist when he reached into the car and Harris fired three more rounds into him.

Real nice.

> Harris said Maybearry&#8217;s hand released in a &#8220;weird&#8221; manner and Harris knew he was dead, court documents say.

&#8220;Weird&#8221; like as though he was just shot in the chest three times? That kind of weird? You don&#8217;t have many pets do you Ryan?
