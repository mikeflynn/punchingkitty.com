Glad to see Nelly isÂ <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/29/branson-mo-officials-arent-comfortable-with-a-nelly-concert/" target="_blank">allowed to preform </a>_<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/29/branson-mo-officials-arent-comfortable-with-a-nelly-concert/" target="_blank">somewhere</a>_ <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/29/branson-mo-officials-arent-comfortable-with-a-nelly-concert/" target="_blank">these days</a>.

Though by the time the show started it wasn&#8217;t much of a secret, Nelly&#8217;s &#8220;surprise&#8221; appearance in which he shared the stage with fellow native St. Louisan Chuck Berry at the Democratic Convention concert downtown last night sure geeked a lot of people up anyway.

Hopefully the fancy dinner and dancing date we took the Democratic Party officials on where we pushed our boobs up and wore that dress that our mom thinks is slutty, but works every time if you know what I mean&#8230;we mean sex&#8230;will get the DNC to feel up our city&#8217;s thigh enough where we can photograph it and bribe them to hold their conference here and then they&#8217;ll figure, &#8220;What the hell?&#8221; and bang us which of course because we are drunk we were a little loose with our rules and now we&#8217;re knocked up with the Democrat&#8217;s baby, but at least we get to go on every 24 hour news network and got to meet that other lady that John Edwards did the same thing too. She might have been a _real_ lady though and not just a city using a lady metaphor.
