The sun was slowing cooking us and we felt drastically under-dressed, but we were there, in the crowd, for St. Louis&#8217; annual Pride Parade yesterday.

Great crowd (in both size and energy) and as always, visually interesting. We had a great time hanging out (though not as much fun as the guy picture above had hanging out) and putting together another Punching Kitty photo montage, which you can watch below or <a href="http://vimeo.com/12906487" target="_blank">in HD at our Vimeo page</a>.

We will happily post our whole set of photos if requested, but this is our favorite shot:
