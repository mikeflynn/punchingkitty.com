[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4184" title="contamination2010-21" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/05/contamination2010-21.jpg?filter=resize&w=300" alt="" />][1]It&#8217;s a bit of a bummer that we won&#8217;t be able to personally cover St. Louis&#8217; &#8220;pop culture/sci fi/horror convention&#8221;, Contamination, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/03/look-out-behind-you-we-have-con-tamination-2010-photos/" target="_blank">like we did last year</a> because of schedule conflicts, but we wanted to give them a mention anyway.

Contamination: 2011, the &#8220;sequel&#8221; to last year&#8217;s even seems to be even bigger with none other than celebrity headliner: Eric Roberts! Oh yes&#8230;Eric Roberts. The star (ahem) of both &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; and &#8220;VH1: Celebrity Rehab&#8221; will be in St. Louis this weekend! Here&#8217;s what else is happening:

> _<a href="http://www.con-tamination.com/" target="_blank">Contamination 2011: The Sequel</a>_ takes place at the Sheraton Chalet in Westport Plaza and is bigger and better with celebrities, film icons, TV stars, sports figures, models/Playmates, filmmakers and musicians.  **Eric Roberts** and “The Boondock Saints” **Sean Patrick Flanery**, **Norman Reedus** and **David Dela Rocco** are headlining the event along with an impressive lineup of icons at this highly anticipated follow-up event.
> 
> In addition to horror fan favorites [Kane “Jason Voorhees” Hodder/“Friday the 13th parts 7-10”, Brad “Michael Myers” Loree/ “Halloween Resurrection,” Bill “Leatherface” Johnson/“Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2” and Tony “Candyman” Todd/”Candyman 1-3”] there will be a first ever “The Fantastic Four” (1994, Corman) reunion, a “Day of the Dead” Reunion, Dan Shor (Ram in 1982’s “Tron”), “Conan the Barbarian” stars Sandahl Bergman and Oakland Raider Ben Davidson and Grammy winning musician G Tom Mac (who wrote the iconic Cry Little Sister from “The Lost Boys”) will perform live with his band.

That&#8217;s a lot of stuff and if you&#8217;re like us, at least half of those people garnered a &#8220;Who?&#8221; response, but we went last year and had a pretty good time walking around the small but packed venue. To be honest, once we got there we had a lot of &#8220;Oh _that&#8217;s_ who that is! I do know that guy!&#8221; moments.

Both <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/04/30/st-louis-horrorsci-fipop-culture-convention-con-tamination-is-this-weekend/" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s interview with Contamination&#8217;s head honcho</a> and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/03/look-out-behind-you-we-have-con-tamination-2010-photos/" target="_blank">our subsequent photo recap</a> should give you a good feel for the event. If you dig horror flicks or could use some good people watching, it&#8217;s worth the admission.
