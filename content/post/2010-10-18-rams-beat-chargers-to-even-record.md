  The Rams <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301017014" target="_blank">beat the Chargers</a> at home Sunday to pull to an unlikely 3 &#8211; 3 record. KMOV had the game for a change and pretty much pissed themselves with an overly-excited post-game show so that was &#8220;fun&#8221;. In the kinda way that watching a retarded kid get excited about tater tots is fun for a second and then you are like &#8220;Dude, calm the hell down. They are just tater tots. There&#8217;s like a 5 lbs bag in the freezer. Sweet god no one tell this kid about ketchup!&#8221;

  1. The Rams _shock_ the Chargers
  2. _Shockingly_ Rams take it to the Chargers
  3. _Grounded_ Rams Manage to _Defuse_ Charger Offense
  4. The Rams Prove _Insulated_ to Chargers _Electric_ Offense
  5. The Name Chargers Relates Well to Electricity Puns
