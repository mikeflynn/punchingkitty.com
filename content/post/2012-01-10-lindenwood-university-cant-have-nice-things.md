Lindenwood University&#8217;s Belleville campus used to have a statue in anchored near the Welcome Center, but that statue was stolen because it&#8217;s St. Louis, and even weird statues anchored in concrete are no longer safe.

> Investigators are trying to get to the bottom of an art heist in Belleville.

Not quite sure this counts as an &#8220;art heist&#8221;. We we think of art heists, we&#8217;re assuming an elaborate scheme to steal a Mona Lisa-type piece, and involve at least one hacker, one super hot chick, a smooth leader and one black dude to be the one that has to start a distraction when the shit goes down&#8230;not two assholes walking straight to it at 2:30am, pushing it over, throwing it in a ditch and then coming back for it with their truck.

> Made of stainless steel and glass, it was nearly nine feet tall. It was the work of artist and Marianist monk, Brother Mel Meyer.
> 
> The sculpture was worth about $8,500, but to people on campus, it was priceless.

&#8230;eh, probably not &#8220;priceless&#8221;. $10 says most kids that go there had no idea that statue existed. Stealing is wrong of course (and pointless because rarely do thieves have nice high-ceiling apartments able to aptly contain an upright statue, so it&#8217;s just going to end up in the garage and Mrs. Thief is going to be all like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you steal these things if they&#8217;re just to to stack up with all those bread makers you stole back in the 90s!&#8221;) but it still seems like we&#8217;re putting too much greatness in to a sculpture that lived on the lawn on some remote campus of a local college in Illinois.

> &#8220;Our initial thoughts are somebody wanted it for a gag or for the value of it, either resale or scrap. There&#8217;s any number of possibilities,&#8221; said Capt. Don Sax.

Well it sounds like there were just three, and we doubt that anyone&#8217;s going to try and resell or scrap it, so we&#8217;re down to the &#8220;gag&#8221; reason. If that&#8217;s the reason, it seems like it would be easier, and just as funny, to poop on it. Less lifting involved and the the only planning required would be a Taco Bell run.
