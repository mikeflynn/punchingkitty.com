We live in the future. Where&#8217;s our god-dammed hoverboard?!

Starting with: &#8220;This [sic] it! I&#8217;m in labor, people!&#8221; KMOV morning anchor and resident cutie, **Virginia Kerr** started the process of labor and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/virginiakerr" target="_blank">a steady stream of tweets</a> up until a few moments before she pooped out her baby boy. &#8230;Is that right? Pooping them out? Sounds right.

> Contractions every two minutes. They broke my water. Epidural is in. No pain! <a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

Ok! Go Virginia!

> Still just hanging out.. I can&#8217;t feel a thing..last check I was dialted to a 3 but they haven&#8217;t checked since my water broke. <a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

Ok, wow. Gross. Time to stop tweeting and have that baby!

> Watching the old movie Wall Street with the hubs. I feel the contractions getting stronger but not painful. Epidural is my friend.<a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

Nothing like having Gordon Gekko be the first voice your child hears.

> At a six now! Nauseated and minor pain. Can&#8217;t wait to see my little dude. Just tweeting that brings tears! <a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

Six? Sounds like someone&#8217;s ready to give birth to a meatball sub.

> We r getting close! Could start pushing soon! <a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

Try White Castle. That always makes us go.

> We are at a 10! Tweeting is helping me cope. Like how the camera helped me do daring things on live tv when I was a feature reporter <a href="http://twitter.com/#search/%23fb" target="_blank">#fb</a>

&#8230;so you&#8217;re saying you need the public eye to do anything daring or exciting Virginia? Awesome! We&#8217;re taking a shot in the dark here and going to guess that this kid was conceived in a KMOV news van&#8230;

Because of our awesome investigative abilities and rugged masculine charm, we managed to accquire the first baby photo of KMOV&#8217;s newest little reporter who already has enough of a resume to be the morning &#8220;traffic guy&#8221;

We knew it! **Larry Connors**, you pimp!
