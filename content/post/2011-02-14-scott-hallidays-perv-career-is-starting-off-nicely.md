A 28-year old man, Scott Halliday, has been arrested in Springfield, Missouri for causing $2,000 dollars worth of damage to a tanning bed.

_How did he do that?_ 

He was standing on it of course!

_Why?_

So he could peep on the girl tanning on the other side of the dividing wall! &#8230;oh did we mention he&#8217;s a perv?

_&#8230;_

Oh and he&#8217;s also being accused of fleeing the scene when a woman busted him for the peeping.

_Anything else?_

Yeah. He&#8217;s also being accused of watching another woman over a similar &#8220;partial wall&#8221; at a different Springfield tanning salon.

_&#8230;wow._

Not done yet! He&#8217;s also currently facing charges of property damage after being accused of slashing he neighbor&#8217;s tires&#8230;wait for it&#8230;because she told him to stop calling her.

Wow, sky&#8217;s the limit for this little up-and-coming perv. After getting a slap on the wrist for all this stuff, it seems like his career path is intact. He&#8217;ll go all the way, nab a Senator&#8217;s daughter and end up getting gunned down in his own basement by Jodie Foster&#8230;but not before he stands back from the camera, opens his robe, and does that man-gina thing right when you aren&#8217;t expecting and and there&#8217;s no time to look away. You bastard!
