One year ago today I typed up the &#8220;launch&#8221; post and threw it online.  Seems like forever ago.

Within that year, we have&#8230;

1. Became popular pretty quickly.

2. Been shutdown by my old employers.

3. Came back months later.

4. Pissed off various radio and tv personalities that for some reason have much thinner skin than you would think they should.

5. Posted roughly 500 posts with 600 comments.

We have some fun plans for this next year!  Stick with us, tell your friends and keep sending those tips!

**How do you think we did for the first year?** Got anything you would like to see more or less of?
