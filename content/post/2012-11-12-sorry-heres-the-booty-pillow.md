We know, we know. It&#8217;s been a rough couple of weeks of posting on here. There&#8217;s been two reasons for that:

1. We&#8217;ve been busy.

2. The only things going on were horrible election stories.

Both of those situations should be past us, so this week should be better.

In other news, &#8220;**The Booty Pillow**&#8221; is a real thing:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/6KoTkjC8wZk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

No we will not &#8220;use it at the office to ease back pain&#8221;! You&#8217;re the one that took the time to manufacture it with a built-in thong design, so think again before you make that suggestion. Why don&#8217;t you just make a pillow that has &#8220;I might rape you if we&#8217;re both working late because I clearly have issues with women.&#8221; embroidered on it, that might be more subtle for the office.

While were on the subject, what&#8217;s the deal with your other usage suggestions?

Based on that screenshot from the commercial, the other uses you suggest are lesbian spooning, and a place for a man and a woman to awkwardly place their hand while laying on the ground? What a product!
