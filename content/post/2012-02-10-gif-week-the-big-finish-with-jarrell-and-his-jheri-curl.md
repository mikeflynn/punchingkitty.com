_[Editor&#8217;s Note: For context, this was part of our impromptu &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/02/10/gif-week-a-look-back/" target="_blank">Animated GIF Week</a>&#8220;]_

The first of today&#8217;s new GIFs features Jarrell, slicking his Jheri Curl back while the camera dramatically zooms back to show the Arch. It&#8217;s god dammed beautiful!

For those unaware, Jarrell is the start of our all-time favorite local commercial from the past featuring a music video format and selling a $27.50! You can see the full commercial, with it&#8217;s unending gif-able moments <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/04/20/this-is-the-greatest-jheri-curl-commercial-ever/" target="_blank">in our archives</a>. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it. It&#8217;s Friday, and we won&#8217;t tell your boss anyway.
