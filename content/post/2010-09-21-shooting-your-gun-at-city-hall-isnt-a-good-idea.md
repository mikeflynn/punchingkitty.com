Sunday morning, in the parking garage of none other than the freaking City Hall of St. Charles, Melissa Pontius (right) got in a little argument with a few other people that were for some reason hanging out at the St. Charles City Hall at 1:30am on a Saturday night. Well, as the story goes, Melissa had just about enough, so did she go off and make fun of her opponents on her blog like all other right-thinking Americans? Nope! She grabbed her gun and fired a shot off in their general direction. Gangsta!

> Police said Pontius was a passenger in a 2009 Infiniti FX-3 leaving the garage about 1:25 a.m. at 200 North 2nd Street when she fired one shot from a Walther P22 (.22-caliber) pistol.
> 
> She and a male friend had just left Main Street in downtown St. Charles, police said. Pontius fired the pistol out the vehicle&#8217;s window after having an argument with a group of people.

Pontius was charged with felony &#8220;shooting a firearm at a person or building&#8221;. Seems like those things should be different laws. A building&#8230;a person. Well, maybe if the law was &#8220;shooting a firearm at a person or really awesome building like a Vegas hotel or bitchin strip club or something&#8221;, but just any building? Dude, there are some stank buildings around here that we would like to think matter a little more than us. Then again, we&#8217;re a super-awesome and sexy blogger, so of course there are buildings we are more important than, but Wal-Mart greeters? &#8230;eh, not so much. Here&#8217;s the final drafts &#8220;shooting a firearm at a kickass person or really awesome building like a Vegas hotel or a bitchin strip club made of gold and bacon or something&#8221; Penalty? Death. &#8220;shooting a firearm at a lame person like a Wal-Mart greeter or that spaz, you know the one, at your office or lame building like crack houses or Applebee&#8217;s&#8221; Penalty? Look, just don&#8217;t do it again. Oh and hey! Don&#8217;t forget your gun.
