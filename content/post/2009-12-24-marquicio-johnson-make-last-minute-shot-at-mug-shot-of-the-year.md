Good guy.

> The great-aunt&#8217;s boyfriend, Marquicio Johnson, 33, was supposed to be watching the child while his girlfriend, a nurse, was working the overnight, 11 p.m.-7 a.m. shift at a Chesterfield nursing home. He called to report the unconscious child at about 8:30 a.m. on Dec. 16.

> Johnson was charged the next day with first-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child. Since the child has since died, police will be asking that charges be upgraded to murder. Prosecutors are awaiting the final medical reports from the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy.

One would think that if you wanted to get that sweet spot of &#8220;2009&#8217;s Best Mug Shot&#8221; it would have been easier to just get drunk and barf on a cop car or something.

The thing I really love about this shot is that he looks like half a makeover away from being one of those dudes that looks like a dude, until he turns the other way and then you are all like &#8220;Oh man!  Now he look like a chick.  I&#8217;m so confused!&#8221;  But then he faces you straight on and then you are all like &#8220;Oh.  Your just weird. Wasn&#8217;t really magic at all was it?&#8221;
