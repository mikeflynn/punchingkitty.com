The former &#8212; he just officially left the post a few weeks ago before the current season began to deal with his health issues &#8212; St. Louis University basketball, Rick Majerus died. He only 64, but with a body like that &#8220;only 64&#8221; turns in to &#8220;somehow made it to 64&#8221; pretty quick.

> Majerus amassed a career record of 517-215, taking Ball State, Utah and Saint Louis to the NCAA tournament a total of 11 times and leading the 1998 Utes on an improbable run to the national title game. Along the way, he built a reputation as an Xs-and-Os mastermind, more comfortable turning a group of lightly recruited players into a formidable team than coaching at a &#8220;Cindy Crawford program&#8221; as he often referred to the North Carolinas and Dukes of the world.

He was also known to <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/3093/majerus-forced-to-fly-commercial-and-hes-not-happy-about-it" target="_blank">go toe to toe against the SLU establishment</a> from time to time, <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/majerus-lights-a-media-flame-slu-coach-s-radio-moves/article_f0061b6a-9d51-5741-b0ff-4d06e032086e.html" target="_blank">decide one day that he won&#8217;t do his ESPN101 radio show</a>, and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/07/does-slu-basketball-coach-rick-majerus-poop-in-towels/" target="_blank">even poop in to the occasional towel</a>. Majerus was our kinda guy, and he will be missed.
