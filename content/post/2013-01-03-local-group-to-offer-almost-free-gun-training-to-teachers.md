SAFTI, Saint Louis Association of Firearms Training Instructors, who&#8217;s acronym is cheating a little too much to get the wink they were going for, is getting some free press today after offering area school teachers &#8220;almost free&#8221; gun training that would allow them to have a &#8220;conceal and carry&#8221; gun permit.

> SAFTI, the Saint Louis Association of Firearms Training Instructors, is offering St. Louis-area school teachers what he calls “almost free” training so they can obtain a concealed carry permit.
> 
> Instructor Michael Meyer said the offer is good for any certified teacher in the St. Louis area or from outstate Missouri.

Because if there&#8217;s any word or mindset you want to brand your gun safety courses with &#8220;almost&#8221; is definitely the way to go. Their first draft of this press release had them describing the nominal fees as &#8220;like a wallet flesh wound&#8221;, so it&#8217;s good to see they scaled it back a bit.

> Meyer says right now the classes would be offered only to those who are certified teachers. However, it is possible that it could expand to include school staff as well.

Yeah, f*ck it! Lets arm the janitor too! He seems like a stable, definitely happy where is life has ended up kinda guy. He&#8217;s already to a holstery-looking thing on that trashcan he wheels around so it&#8217;s perfect!
