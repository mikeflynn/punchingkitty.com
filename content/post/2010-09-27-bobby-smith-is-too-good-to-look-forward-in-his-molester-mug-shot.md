Can&#8217;t imagine how the wheels came of this seemingly perfect plan&#8230;

> Bobby Smith, 32, of Pontoon Beach, IL, was charged with 2 counts of solicitation to meet a child.
> 
> Smith was indicating that he was a student named “Stevie Smith,” at the Granite City High School. Smith was soliciting sexual acts from the females in the text messages.

&#8220;Stevie&#8221; Smith? He&#8217;s only 32 but somehow thinks kids these days have reverted back to the 50&#8217;s where seemingly everyone was called Stevie, Wally and Mikey. When the hell did anyone that goes by Stevie ever get a chick?! This whole plot was screwed from the beginning, but according to prosecutors, a plan to get up under that training bra is illegal no matter how stupid it is.

Another mystery entirely is why Smith thinks he is too damn fancy a molester to look right in to the camera for his mug shot, instead choosing to go with the coy smile approach that has yet to work well with juries. I bet he text messages 12 year olds with his pinkies up too.
