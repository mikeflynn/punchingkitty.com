For the second time in the last few weeks the Globe Democrat, St. Louis&#8217; newest (but also totally old) news source, has made themselves look a little silly.

First there was <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/02/12/bernie-vs-fox-2-and-the-globe-democrat/" target="_blank">their public tiff with Post Dispatch sports columnist Bernie Miklasz</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/miklasz" target="_blank"></a>that columnated in an &#8220;Why is everyone always picking on me?&#8221; post from their sports editor&#8230;you know because guys that did nothing wrong always have to explain themselves&#8230;

Then today, the very Globe Democrat reporter that came in second place to Miklasz in the &#8220;Who is buying the Rams&#8221; sweepstakes stepped in it again.  Way to go annoying radio voice, and overly inflated talking head <a href="http://twitter.com/HBalzer721" target="_blank">Howard Balzer</a>!

Like most things these days, all the action happened over Twitter.

Step One: Say something that everyone is going to go crazy about but still really vague:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3275" title="mark_bulger_1" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mark_bulger_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="200" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_1.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_1-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]Woah!  Huge scoop there Balzer!  Everyone wants to see Bulger lose his horns, and this is huge.  There is one little detail though&#8230; (thanks to [Bernie][2])

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3276" title="mark_bulger_2" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mark_bulger_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="264" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_2.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_2-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][3]Well either the Rams let go of a whole lot of players today, or Balzer jumped the gun.  Lets see how he covers his bearded ass on this one&#8230;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3277" title="mark_bulger_3" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mark_bulger_3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="277" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_3.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/02/mark_bulger_3-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][4]

Um, ok.  So why did the other 59 guys pack up?  Because they _did_ expect to get back?  Nice try.

In other news, Steven Jackson blew his nose and Coach Spags took a dump.  Interpet those as you wish.
