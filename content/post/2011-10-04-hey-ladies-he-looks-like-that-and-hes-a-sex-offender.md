Michael Campbell of Springfield, Missouri was arrested the other day after coming within 500 feet of a playground or public pool. Campbell was detained, not because he looks like the freaking boogey man, but because he&#8217;s also a sex offender, adding a second reason he should be nowhere near children. How this creepy bastard doesn&#8217;t have a crappy SyFy Channel or Lifetime movie about him yet, we have no idea.

> As seen [right], Campbell is known in these parts for the remarkable transformation undergone by his face. The “before” photo was taken following a 2003 theft arrest. Five years later, he had used up almost all the free space on his mug.
> 
> Campbell was booked into the county lockup Sunday and later released. He presumably returned to the residence listed on his page in the Missouri sex offender registry.

Geez, give the guy a break. Everyone&#8217;s all knocking on his look&#8230;&#8221;What&#8217;s with the forehead pentagram?!&#8221; his mom always says. Just like a mom. You go out of  your way to tattoo on a bow tie and does she notice? No. Of course not.
