You cover chest and you expose the face, cover your face with the baby and you expose your chest as well as your nose to any baby stink. The trick really is to find the perfect mix of size and cute &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t shoot me, would you Mr. Policeman?&#8221; factor. Your best bet is Justin Bieber, but the Biebs wasn&#8217;t in North St. Louis the other day, so one would have to improvise with a baby.

> Police said the 40-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman got into an argument around 11 p.m. at the corner of Delmar and Academy.
> 
> As the argument escalated the man shot a gun in the air and then ran into a house with a one-month-old infant in his arms. According to officials, the man never threatened to harm the child.

Police managed to talk the guy out of the house a couple of hours later and no one was harmed.

The incident happened just weeks before the city rolled out it&#8217;s new tax payer funded &#8220;flak jacket papoose&#8221; program. Sure it seems dangerous to have your kid strapped to your chest during a gun fight with the police, but in North St. Louis being shot is like the chicken pox&#8230;it&#8217;s better to just get it over with while they&#8217;re young.
