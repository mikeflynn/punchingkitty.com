[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2036" title="California Homes" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/housing-market-bl.jpg" alt="California Homes" width="600" height="252" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/10/housing-market-bl.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/10/housing-market-bl-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]Wait wait wait wait.  You are telling me that in this totally awesome housing market, the maker of St. Charles County&#8217;s most famous compound, with all those shiny new houses, isn&#8217;t doing well?

Totally.  Shocking.

Did you pick up on the sarcasm?  We were laying it down pretty thick.

Oh but apparently there is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spin</span> good news.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, they are still totally going bankrupt, but apparently its the good kind or something:

> In a statement on the company’s website, Whittaker says that despite “a nationwide decline in the housing market, an unyieldingly tight credit market and the overall uncertainty in the economy attributed to the global financial crisis” it wrote 98 contracts in the second and third quarters of 2009.

Hey look everyone!  We are the world&#8217;s tallest midget!
