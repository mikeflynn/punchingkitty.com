Fire and the wheel are totally important and we wouldn&#8217;t be where we are today without them, but dude&#8230;Buffalo Chicken Cupcakes exist now and that&#8217;s just too awesome to ignore. But a big thank you to &#8220;fire&#8221; which helped bake them, and to &#8220;the wheel&#8221; for&#8230;uh&#8230;well we&#8217;re pretty sure there&#8217;s a wheel involved behind the scenes somewhere.

Here&#8217;s to Stef, the St. Louisan behind Cup Cake Project.com, and our new favorite person ever.

We previously thought the internet would never produce anything more desirable than crazy websites full of asian porn, but here we are staring just as intently at our monitor, but for a cupcake&#8230;drooling and self-touching levels are about the same as well.
