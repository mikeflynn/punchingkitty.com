In fact, Buehrle made news in December when his wife found a dog walking around St. Louis with an arrow sticking out of it and donated money to pay for the dog&#8217;s medical bills as well as found the dog a home. No word on if the dog has a comical water stream shoot out of his side when he drinks water, but it&#8217;s still a good story and makes Mark Buehrle seem like a really nice guy that cares.

&#8230;and now we have this:

> &#8220;He had a great year and a great comeback, but there were times where we watched the game, and I know it&#8217;s bad to say, but there were times where we hope he gets hurt,&#8221; Buehrle told MLB.com. &#8220;Everything you&#8217;ve done to these dogs, something bad needs to happen to these guys.&#8221;

Yeah dude, that _is_ &#8220;bad&#8221; to say. It makes you look like a moronic psycho Mark Buehrle. &#8220;&#8230;something bad needs to happen to [Vick]&#8221;?! He went to freaking jail for 2 years! Where the hell have you been dude? No one&#8217;s saying you gotta like the guy or hang out on the weekends, but the man did serve his time, and how does you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">publicly</span> wishing he would get hurt help the dogs? None of this makes any sense and makes a guy that seems like a nice guy by all accounts, come off like a nutcase. Here&#8217;s an idea: Maybe  you should be non-violent to all living things, instead of just the ones that lick you in that place you like when no one&#8217;s around during the off-season and you just bought peanut butter.

Buehrle&#8217;s quotes where later removed from <a href="http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110209&content_id=16602638&vkey=news_cws&c_id=cws" target="_blank">the original story</a> by MLB beat writer Scott Merkin, but the internet has a special talent of being sticky&#8230;which explains my keyboard! Yup, that&#8217;s gotta be it. No other way it could get that way. Had to have been from the internet&#8217;s general stickiness and nothing in particular. On an unrelated note, we&#8217;re out of lotion. If you go by the store we could use some&#8230;really dry out&#8230;because of the winter and all.
