An update on what we&#8217;ve coined as &#8220;**<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/poopstock/" target="_blank">Poopstock</a>**&#8220;&#8230;

In case you missed it, the (bird) shit hit the fan in St. Louis over the weekend when rock band Kings of Leon bolted from their show 3 songs deep because a bird pooped on them. Apparently the taste of bird shit was too much to handle despite the fact that they&#8217;ve been feeding us shitty songs for some time now.

The story got lots of coverage here in St. Louis over the weekend and now its getting national attention. Fingers crossed for Kings of Leon about that whole &#8220;any press is good press&#8221; thing.

Lets count the times the author used a &#8220;shitty&#8221; pun for their title. (meta joke!)
