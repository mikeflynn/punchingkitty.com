If that sounds like a pop culture-gasm then dude (yeah, I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re a dude) you should get your ass to Con-tamination this weekend.

> St. Louis&#8217; first Horror, Sci-Fi & Pop Culture convention all under one roof!Â  A weekend packed with toxic celebrities, contagious dealers, viral gamers, brain hemorrhaging music and other coma inducing activities.

With the first of hopefully many Con-tamination&#8217;s already upon us, we got the chance to wait in the dark and then sneak up all slow and creep like behind Con-tamination and Dyer Straits Productions&#8217; mad scientist Dave Dyer, who was nice enough to not only drop all the charges but answer some questions for us too.

> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">Punching Kitty:</span>** <span style="color: #ff99cc;"></span>Thanks for taking the time to talk to us Dave, we realize its got to be a pretty crazy time right now.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** This is the first year for what you are calling a &#8220;horror, sci-fi, pop culture&#8221; convention. What was the driving force to put this together?
> 
> **Dave Dyer:** I have been a dealer/vendor for many years & I have always wondered why there hasn&#8217;t been a show in St. Louis like all the ones I have worked at. I thought it would be a brilliant Idea to do one myself.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** &#8230;and why St. Louis? Every area has geeks that love zombies, but is St. Louis particularly suited for this convention?
> 
> **Dyer:** Well this is not only a Horror but a Sci-Fi & Pop Culture event. I knew that in order to keep viable in this industry I need to think outside the box. St. Louis is my home town & the gateway to the Midwest it only makes sense that St. Louis should play with the big dogs, It is Hub to so many states & a large area with many fans of the genre.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** The line up this year appears to be especially horror focused despite the eclectic description, was that planned, did it just work out that way?
> 
> **Dyer:** It just worked that way, It was not planned I really wanted to try to represent all of the genres we are covering but it did not work out that way! This year we are a little bit more Horror but next year we will make it up by going more Sci-Fi! That&#8217;s whats so wonderful about &#8220;Contamination&#8221; we have created something that can be very flexible.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** How have sales been? Are you expecting a good turn out for the event?
> 
> **Dyer:** Sales of course for a first show started out slow but with our media campaign it has picked up & started a momentum that we hope will continue through the show.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** You have a pretty awesome list of celebrities coming in for the event, including two guys from the classic &#8220;Dusk Til Dawn&#8221; flick, Tom Savini and Fred &#8220;The Hammer&#8221; Williamson. What are you most excited about?
> 
> **Dyer:** I have known Tom & Fred for a while so they are like old friends to me so I am most excited about Daredevil Bob Gill who was one of the greatest daredevil,s of all time breaking all of Evils records without the aid of a ramp, until his accident in 1974. Also I am looking forward to having Lorri Cardille from &#8220;Dead of the Dead&#8221;.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** What would happen if someone rolled in to the costume contest rocking an Edward from Twilight costume?
> 
> **Dyer:** They would most likely be laughed at this Is a Zombie Town all the way!
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** We love that not only are you talking about horror movies but you have a pretty impressive list of people showing their flicks over the weekend. Are there any budding horror flim-makers that we shouldn&#8217;t miss?
> 
> **Dyer:** Yeah! You don&#8217;t want to miss any of the up & coming Filmmakers we are showcasing! Wicked Pixel & Pirate Pictures from St. Louis are our homeboys but we have some filmmakers from Chicago & Milwaukee also.
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** Maybe this is too soon, but any thoughts towards doing this again next year?
> 
> **Dyer:** OH YEAH! We are already planning next year & it&#8217;s going to be even better!!!
> 
> **<span style="color: #ff00ff;">PK:</span>** Lastly, which do you prefer, the classic slow-moving zombies or the new-style running zombies?
> 
> **Dyer:** Slow Moving Baby! George Romero all the way!!!!!
