Is this really the best way you could &#8220;report&#8221; on the passing of Deanne Lane, formerly of KSDK&#8217;s, husband passing away suddenly?

> It’s been a great week so far, any way you look at it (provided you weren’t looking at it from Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea or the house of Centene communicator and former television anchor **Deanne Lane**, who is mourning the sudden death of her husband, consultant and avid golfer **Greg Goodrich**

That&#8217;s freaking horrible. &#8220;Today is the best day ever! So great! Today is so awesome&#8230;unless you are this dude here, who&#8217;s mom got ran over by a golf cart this morning.&#8221; Then follow up by comparing Lane&#8217;s husband&#8217;s death to life inIraq, Afghanistan and North Korea? Good call. It&#8217;s probably just like living there. Really slick (guy who writes for) Jerry Burger.

Can&#8217;t wait to hear about the District Whatever Representative that went to one of your friends&#8217; restaurant openings. Super exciting stuff.
