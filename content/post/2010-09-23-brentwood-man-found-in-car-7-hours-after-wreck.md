Seven hours this guy was stuck in his car after a fairly serious car accident that apparently no one noticed.

> MoDOT and a passer-by are credited with saving a 56-year-old Brentwood man who was trapped in his car for more than seven hours after a crash.
> 
> Investigators believe the driver, identified as 56-year-old Roger K. Boyd, was knocked unconscious as a result of the crash, which happened around 8:30 a.m.
> 
> Someone spotted the vehicle and then a MoDOT maintenance worker arrived on the scene around 12:50 p.m.

Once Boyd was removed from his 7-hour stay at the &#8220;Hotel I Just Pissed Myself and then Bled in to the Piss&#8221; all he could say was &#8220;I&#8217;m sore.&#8221;Â Boyd was then taken to DePaul Hospital and is currently in good condition.

But where could a man crash his car during rush hour and not have a soul find him for 7 hours? Apparently Boyd somehow managed to smash his car in to a Dell Computer kiosk at the mall. Have you seen those things? No one&#8217;s there. No one! Around noon an old lady made eye contact, walked up and asked if this was where she could get &#8220;a fruit machine, computer thing&#8221; and after being pointed to the Apple Store, she looked back and said &#8220;You know someone crashed in to your kiosk right?&#8221; Thank god for that woman or he might be have been there for days.

_[Editor&#8217;s Note: Seriously though, he was in a ditch on I-170 just north of I-70, which sound like it might have somehow been more fun.]_
