We were a bit shocked when we saw this news.  Do secretaries really think just busting out the ole company checkbook and writing some checks to themselves seem like a good idea still?

> Andrea Wild wrote some signed checks from her employer to pay her own personal expenses, including utility bills, home mortgage, credit card bills and car loan payments, according to the indictment.
> 
> She also allegedly wrote some checks directly to herself.
> 
> This was all done without the knowledge of her employer, who was not identified in court documents.

Oh, well thank god for the awesome reporter&#8217;s instinct that told them to keep that last part in there or she could have totally used the &#8220;He said it was cool.&#8221; defense.

In cases like these, we suggest just letting the secretary go.  Sure you&#8217;ll be out of some money, but it will be much worse for her when she pulls over and says to herself &#8220;I&#8217;ll hide out in this motel at the foot of a hill with a creepy mansion on top for the night.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!  Dead.

Crime doesn&#8217;t pay.
