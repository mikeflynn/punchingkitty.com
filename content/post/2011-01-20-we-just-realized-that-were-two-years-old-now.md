Here&#8217;s a link to the very first &#8220;intro&#8221; post on Punching Kitty that went up on January 14th, 2009: &#8220;<a rel="bookmark" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/01/14/welcome-to-punchingkittycom/">Hell Yeah Bitch! .com Launches PunchingKitty.com!</a>&#8220;

In two years we&#8217;ve managed 1,258 posts, 2 legal threats, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/press/" target="_blank">a decent amount of press</a>, one <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/06/27/yeah-were-back/" target="_blank">hiatus of sorts</a> and managed to get over 600 people to stand up on Facebook and say they like us.

It&#8217;s been fun, so we wanted to thank all our readers, both old and new. As long as it stays fun, we&#8217;ll keep working to keep you entertained for another year.

_Check out our <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/category/meta" target="_blank">&#8220;Meta&#8221; category</a> for look back on the last two years!_
