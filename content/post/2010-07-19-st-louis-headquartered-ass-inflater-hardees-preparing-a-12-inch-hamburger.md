St. Louis takes a step closer to killing everyone as Hardee&#8217;s, the fast food chain known for big burgers and calls St. Louis it&#8217;s corporate home, is currently market testing that crazy but beautiful behemoth pictured above: The foot-long hamburger.

> The foot-long burger idea was hatched two months ago from a product development chef at Carl&#8217;s [Jr., the other half of Hardee&#8217;s], says Brad Haley, marketing chief. The chain is especially eager to create products that appeal to its core customers: young men ages 18 to 24. &#8220;Obviously, the foot-long sandwich has been very successful at Subway. But we decided to do it the Carl&#8217;s way.&#8221;

The details for this sexy little number include: 3 hamburger patties, three pieces of cheese&#8230;well, really, its three hamburgers on a single, large white bread sub sandwich roll. It will clock in at 850 calories and 20 grams of white while only costing you **$4** ($.5o if you want the trimmings).

If the test markets like it, and lets face it&#8230;they will&#8230;the foot-long hamburger can be filling our collective gullets in three to six months.

The question is: Why weren&#8217;t we in on this market test? What does Southern California and Indiana have that we don&#8217;t? We like to eat crazy amounts of food that will kill us too. Have you even seen Gooey Butter Cake? Guess what the main ingredient is.
