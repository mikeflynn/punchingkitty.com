Go check it out.  We&#8217;ll wait.

Have you ever seen a dog happier than <a href="http://imgur.com/annBL.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>?  Oh, your back.  Lets continue.

Well we have an update to that story, once again, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/b5kai/what_happened_to_the_cheating/" target="_blank">courtesy of Reddit</a>.

> Hey, How&#8217;s it going? I wanted to thank you for your craigslist post. I&#8217;m not Kris, my name is Ed. I don&#8217;t know if your story involved me or not, but it sure got things done, in my life.
> 
> My sister is a bit of a whore, and I always see her messing around with guys on facebook. I resent the fact that she does that since it would kill me to see my girlfriend whoring it up with douches. Anyway, Kris knows about her facebook &#8220;friends&#8221; but he trusts her too much. I feel bad for him at times because he pays for my sister&#8217;s living expenses, and she treats him like shit. Also, my sister has a bunch of whory coworkers in st. louis that I always see on facebook. Maybe one of those skanks was the one at the pub.
> 
> Maybe your story was about my sister&#8217;s boyfriend, and maybe it wasn&#8217;t
> 
> Whether it was my sister at the pub or not, I forwarded the email to Kris.
> 
> He replied, &#8220;thanks, I&#8217;ll let her know.&#8221;
> 
> A while later I see her facebook relationship status as single.

Was this the Chris or Kris that the guy was originally talking about?  We&#8217;ll never know, but putting the screws to one cheating skank is good enough for us!

Please, women of St. Louis, if you see this guy out this weekend, give him a freebie.  If he&#8217;s ugly, get drunk first.  It&#8217;ll be a good dead and even though you&#8217;re technically being slutty, I think its like a &#8220;get in to heaven&#8221; grey area.  I think Jesus has to be cool with it.
