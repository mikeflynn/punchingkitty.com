The young guard for the Washingon Wizards, Bradley Beal, wasn&#8217;t even watching the Cardinals game Friday night when they were coming back on a stunned Nationals teams and their fans, but when we saw <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/10/13/the-cardinals-just-accomplished-the-largest-comeback-in-a-postseason-elimination-game-ever/" target="_blank">the Cardinals won</a> he reached for <a href="https://twitter.com/RealDealBeal23" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. He _is_ from St. Louis after all.

> STL turnupppp !!!

&#8230;I guess that&#8217;s means something to the effect of &#8220;I&#8217;m happy the Cardinals won.&#8221; because that&#8217;s how most of Washington-area fans took it, and it did not go over particularly well.

> “I was hearing threats and everything, like, ‘Watch your back,’ “ Beal said on Saturday before getting his first start of the preseason against Cleveland. “People were like, ‘I’m not going to cheer for you.’ I was like, whatever. It was cool, though.”
> 
> Beal was openly rooting for the Cardinals before the series began and has worn the team’s cap to practice all week. He decided to send out a series of tweets to explain his position.
> 
> “People forget I’m from St. Louis ! Lol#STL,” Beal wrote. “It was a great comeback for my home team, am I wrong for cheering them on?”
> 
> He then explained, “Just because I cheer for my team doesn’t mean I don’t support the Nats.”

Here&#8217;s Beals tweets from that night:

&#8230;and here&#8217;s a sampling from the D.C. fans:

  <a href="https://twitter.com/robertkrakaur/status/256978922879721472"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14830" title="Twitter _ RobertKrakaur_ @RealDealBeal23 go back to ..." src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/10/Twitter-_-RobertKrakaur_-@RealDealBeal23-go-back-to-....jpg" alt="" width="466" height="208" /></a>
</p>

Poor guy can&#8217;t even root for his own team?  That&#8217;s cold D.C., but Beal is taking the shots in stride:

> “It was probably moreso the timing, but at the same time, it’s my city,” Beal said of St. Louis. “It’s not going to affect the way I play. I got to do something to redeem myself, I guess.”

Do what you gotta do man, just don&#8217;t be like the <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/10/11/5-reasons-why-the-nationals-bryce-harper-is-a-douche/" target="_blank">other D.C.-area rookies and turn in to a douche.</a>
