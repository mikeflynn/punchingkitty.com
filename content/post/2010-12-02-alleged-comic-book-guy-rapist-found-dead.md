> It took St. Louis police 3 and a half hours to peaceably coax suspected rapist and comic book shop owner, Kenneth McClure, to put down his weapon and come out of his south Hampton store, **Legends Comics & Sports Cards**.

So anyway, he&#8217;s dead now.

> A man found dead in St. Louis County Tuesday was charged earlier this year in a statutory rape case and had been arrested after a standoff with police in October, a relative said.
> 
> The man&#8217;s nephew identified the shooting victim found by St. Louis County police at Route 66 State Park as Kenneth McClure, 57, of St. Louis. His body was found a few hours after he missed an apperance [sic] in the court case against him.

Running late to the court case and claiming car trouble, McClure was apparently shot just after contacting his lawyer.

> &#8220;This is the first time I was waiting for a client and I found out he was murdered while I was waiting,&#8221; said [McClure&#8217;s attorney, Jim Pree].

OMG no way! This is the first time we&#8217;ve ever read about how a lawyer was waiting for a client and later found out he was killed while he was waiting. Weeeeeiiiiiiirrrrrrd!
