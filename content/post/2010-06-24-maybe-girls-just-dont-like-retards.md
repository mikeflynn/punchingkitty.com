> **to the girls on the hiway[sic] im[sic] their cars &#8211; m4w (interstates[sic])**
  
> every day i drive down the road.in a shiny jeep all decked out.and i see so many pretty ladies going by,shopping,to work,to who knows where.they are all fantastic looking.but do they look at me or anyone?

_&#8220;hiway&#8221;_? &#8220;_im their cars_&#8220;? &#8220;_they are all fantastic looking_&#8220;?! Why can&#8217;t this guy learn to write and where is he driving where all the girls on the street are fantastic looking?!

Can&#8217;t imagine why the women of St. Louis wouldn&#8217;t want to make eye contact with creepy retard in his jeep as he gawks at them driving by. This then leads to the follow-up question: What if they do make eye-contact? What then? You going to pull over and they&#8217;ll run to your arms in slow motion? Girls don&#8217;t do that dude. If they run at all, its away from you&#8230;eventually they get tired though&#8230;its all about keeping in shape&#8230;.and getting one of those big white no-windows-in-the-back vans&#8230;and duct tape.
