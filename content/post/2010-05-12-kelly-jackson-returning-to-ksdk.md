Kelly Jackson left KSDK a few years ago to sow her wild oats at other stations no one&#8217;s ever heard of&#8230;but now, she&#8217;s back!

Do you remember her, because we sure don&#8217;t.

We do know that while she was gone from St. Louis news she got a little national attention for screaming like a wuss when some masked goblins ran across her set. The clip went, as the kids say, viral and even appeared on CNN (embedded below).

After the scare Jackson (second from the right in the video) was quoted as saying:

> I always wondered if any sound would come out of my mouth if I was frightened, and I didn&#8217;t disappoint! It was a Scooby Doo moment!

Hmmm. We don&#8217;t remember any hysterical black women on Scooby Doo, but you know, those were different times. Â They had the Harlem Globetrotters on there, but we aren&#8217;t sure that counts.
