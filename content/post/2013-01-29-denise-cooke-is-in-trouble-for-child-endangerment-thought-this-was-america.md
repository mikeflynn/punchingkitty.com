Denise Cooke was just going to be gone for a second, so we&#8217;re not sure what the big deal is. Some times you need a quick drink, you know? &#8230;and also during some of those times you&#8217;re a single mother, so maybe you leave your baby in a hotel room. Big whoop. Oh, you&#8217;d rather her take the baby to the bar? Who&#8217;s the horrible parent now?!

> Police arrested a woman who allegedly left her 9-year-old son inside a Fenton hotel room while she went out drinking.
> 
> Authorities said Cooke, who&#8217;s from Indianapolis, Indiana, returned to the hotel sometime Monday afternoon. She told police she had gone out for a few drinks and did not intend to leave her child alone for so long.

&#8220;Ok you guys, that&#8217;s the last drink. I really need to head back and make sure the kid I left in that hotel room isn&#8217;t dead. &#8230;one more? Alright, one more! But only because you gave me that look while saying &#8216;What are you doing here? You should leave.&#8221;, and I didn&#8217;t really want to go check on him anyway. You know how that always gets me, but this is totally the last one! I&#8217;m serious!&#8221;

> Police said they did not know exactly how long Cooke was gone. She now faces child endangerment charges.

Doesn&#8217;t this seem like a total non-punishment? Why bother even telling her you were going to take the kid?

&#8220;You left your kid all alone while you went out drinking!?&#8221;

&#8220;Yup, it&#8217;s my kid. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, we have to take your kid away now.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, sweet! Pretty obvious I didn&#8217;t want him anyway, so thanks for finally getting on that. Where were you guys when I let him play with that wood chipper for 6 hours while I banged two guys for a sixer of Smirnoff Ice?&#8221;
