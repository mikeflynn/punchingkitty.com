Being too drunk is usually a problem but sometimes, particularly in St. Louis, it&#8217;s a great thing. For example, it&#8217;s the only way to get really excited about going to City Diner. It makes you completely unaware of stabbings, and not in just the Dateline Mystery &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t remember stabbing my wife&#8230;&#8221; kind of way.

> Police are investigating the possible stabbing of a middle-aged man after his sister noticed several lacerations on his body Saturday night.

His sister noticed? Was the guy dead?

> The victim&#8217;s sister tells police that she found the 57-year-old sitting on the front porch of their residence in the 3100 block of Henrietta around 10:05 p.m.

Sitting?

> The woman advised her brother to come inside and lie down.

What? He was sitting, conscious, on the porch but his sister discovered the stabbings?!

> When she took off his jacket and shirt, she reportedly observed lacerations on the victim&#8217;s chest, neck and back.
> 
> According to police, the victim was extremely intoxicated and unaware of his injuries.

This is a good message for the kids of St. Louis: You&#8217;re going to be stabbed, you just are, so just make sure you&#8217;re drunk when it happens and you won&#8217;t even notice being stabbed in your chest, back and neck(!).

> The victim was unable to provide any details of the incident.

You don&#8217;t say.

Our drunken hero is in an area hospital recovering from his injuries and dealing with a pretty crazy hangover. In the meantime, we&#8217;re going to try and get the phrase &#8220;stabbed in the neck drunk&#8221; in to the area&#8217;s common vernacular.

> Girl: &#8220;Wow what happened last night?&#8221;
> 
> Guy: &#8220;Well you got pretty hammered.&#8221;
> 
> Girl: &#8220;Oh shit, did I git stabbed in the neck drunk?!&#8221;
> 
> Guy: &#8220;Not sure, but I stabbed you other places and you definitely never noticed.&#8221;
