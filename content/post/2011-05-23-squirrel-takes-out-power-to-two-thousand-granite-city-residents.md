A squirrel who hopped in to the Ameren Illinois &#8220;distribution line&#8221; caused nearly 2,000 customers to lose power Sunday morning.

> Ameren Illinois spokesperson Natalie Hemmer says a squirrel got into a distribution line Sunday morning, knocking out service to 1,904 customers.  Granite City was the area mostly affected.

Early thoughts were that the squirrel was suicidal over the lost of Macho Man Randy Savage, while others believed that the rodent was a fervent rapture believer and couldn&#8217;t stand the shame of seeing his fellow squirrels on Monday.

The squirrel died, just as Lindsay Lohan will some day&#8230;on its back, all fried looking, with a mouthful of nuts.
