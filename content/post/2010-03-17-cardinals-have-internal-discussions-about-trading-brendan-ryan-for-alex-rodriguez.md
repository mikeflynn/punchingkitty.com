It is not clear whether the Cardinals have brought this idea to the attention of the Yankees. Even if the Yankees were actually to consider this offer it might be a difficult to one to work out as A-Rod is a good contributor and has recently bonded with the New York fans after reclaiming the World Series title in 2009.

We asked a Cardinals&#8217; official about these internal discussions who responded only with &#8220;What?! This is completely stupid&#8230;wait, how did you get this number?&#8221;

Money could be a possible issue on this deal as Rodriguez makes a staggering $27.5 Million dollars a year, but the issue is side-stepped as the Cardinals&#8217; internal discussions involve the Yankees picking up all of the money owned to Rodriguez for some reason. Also the internal discussions involve the Yankees would deliver muffins to the Cardinals on the completion of the deal.

This news may well echo <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4994845" target="_blank">the recent news</a> of the Phillies internal discussions involving a trade of Ryan Howard to the Cardinals for reigning MVP Albert Pujols.  Speaking of that deal, here&#8217;s what Buster Onley, the story&#8217;s author, had this today in <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/blog?name=olney_buster&id=4999550" target="_blank">his blog</a> (ESPN Insider required):

> About the Howard/Pujols story the other day: What was written was dead-on.
> 
> I did not write that there were ongoing discussions between the two teams.
  
> I did not write that the Cardinals had an inclination to deal Pujols.
  
> I did not write that the Phillies are looking to dump Ryan Howard.
> 
> Internal discussions are part of the sport. It&#8217;s how the Phillies got to the point that they pursued Mike Lowell and Halladay, in spite of their flat denials. I once wrote a story about their serious interest in Lowell, and club executives shot it down as untrue; an assertion that was, in itself, completely untrue.
> 
> Internal discussions are how the Cardinals got to the point that they made a deal last summer for Matt Holliday. Quite frankly, if the Phillies&#8217; executives didn&#8217;t have those kinds of conversations, they wouldn&#8217;t be doing their jobs.
> 
> And as a reporter, when you have confirmed information that the Phillies have discussed internally an avenue through which they might pursue the best player in baseball &#8212; and you know exactly who said what to whom, and how sturdy the intent was &#8212; that is news.
> 
> The only difference was, in this case, that the internal conversations were about two superstars. And while it may be inconvenient to some, it&#8217;s credible.

Not only that, but Buster was also a guest on 101 ESPN&#8217;s _Burwell and Someoneelse_ show. Don&#8217;t get shocked now, but Burwell didn&#8217;t exactly ask the important questions as much as verbally **<span style="font-weight: normal;">fellate</span>** Olney over the WXOS airwaves. The &#8220;interview&#8221; consisted of them bashing everyone for not reading the Olney piece and then Burwell saying that he &#8220;feels Olney&#8217;s pain.&#8221;

Look guys, yes there were those that, for some reason, read Olney&#8217;s piece and thought a trade was in the works, but I think they are the minority.  The real question is: How is this even news?  Buster himself even says in his reply

> Quite frankly, if the Phillies&#8217; executives didn&#8217;t have those kinds of conversations, they wouldn&#8217;t be doing their jobs.

And I think we can all agree that probably every MLB team at one point or another, has said internally &#8220;How the hell do we get Pujols on his team.&#8221;  So once again we ask, how the hell is this news?  We usually like Buster Olney, but later this season, please don&#8217;t tell us all about the internal discussions the Phillies have about where to go to lunch.
