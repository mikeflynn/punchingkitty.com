Ahhhhh! Breaking news from KSDK! A class of eighth grade students and their teachers were attacked!!!! &#8230;by yellow jackets&#8230;and it was last Thursday. One girl got stung a bunch of times, but she&#8217;s fine. Hmm. Seems like there should be more here&#8230;oh wait! Check out this picture KSDK made! Aaaaaaahhhhh!

  We swear to you that we did not make that. It&#8217;s legit, and stupid. It&#8217;s legitimately stupid.

  Sooo&#8230;on yeah. Aaaahhhhh! What happened to these poor students that had a total emergency when being attacked by that giant bug and that drop-shadowed font, but not enough for KSDK to report on it then?

> After the group ran from the swarm, they waited for emergency workers at a pavilion. Firefighters praised the students and the teachers for not panicking.

> Officials said there was no way to prevent the attack. But it helped that the teachers had just completed a required wilderness training program.

Ok, dammit. Kids going outside and getting stung isn&#8217;t news! No, it doesn&#8217;t help that you put a 20 pt font in front of the yellow jacket picture&#8230;.I mean maybe if the text was blinking&#8230;but even then, only barely.
