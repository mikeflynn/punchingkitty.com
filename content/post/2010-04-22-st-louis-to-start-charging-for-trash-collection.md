The free ride might be over for St. Louis city residents who have been living the good life with &#8220;free&#8221; trash pick up.

> On Wednesday, city leaders released a proposed budget that includes a provision for homeowners to pay $8 a month for trash services. The city said the move would raise $10 million in the next budget.
> 
> City leaders claim that many county residents currently pay for trash service. In some communities, trash collection costs homeowners up to $20 a month.

&#8230;and do those county residents also have to give 1% of their income over to their local government every year? Ok, great. Douchebagsayswhat?

We here at Punching Kitty are all for the city relieving it&#8217;s monetary woes, but potentially picking up less trash because someone didn&#8217;t pay their bill is a slipper slope to Detroit. Make your money, but keep picking up all the trash you can as often as you can. You accidentally compact a bum? Eh, it happens.

Also, maybe trash pickup shouldn&#8217;t be all that much of a focus right now. Things seem to be going pretty good there. Oh by the way I drove past four kids in the street at 11am on a Tuesday being taught how to hunt for food by a ferrel dog, but yeah, lets make sure that trash pick up is making the bank.
