We&#8217;re a real website now baby!  We have stickers!

They are a little basic in this first run, but we think they turned out great thanks to our friends at [Contagious Graphics][2].

**So how do you get them?**

One way is to find me.  If I&#8217;m out and about I&#8217;ll say so on [the Punching Kitty Twitter page][3] so try to meet up and I&#8217;ll give you a few.

You can also email me here: editor at punchingkitty dot com and tell me you want some stickers along with your address and I&#8217;ll drop a few in the mail for you!

Yup, its just that simple.

**What should I do with them?**

Put them on your laptop, your car, your notebook, your cat, street signs, anything really, and then **snap a photo** of where you put it and send it to us!  We would love to see where you put our stickers and if you say its ok, we&#8217;ll post it up here to share will everyone else!
