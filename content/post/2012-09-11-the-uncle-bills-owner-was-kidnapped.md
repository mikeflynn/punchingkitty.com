The owner of Uncle Bill&#8217;s Pancake & Dinner House was kidnapped and robbed Sunday. Bet you thought it was the South City location didn&#8217;t you?! Ha, wrong! It was the Ballwin location! Suck it! City: 1, County: 23,474,932,729,239,234,324,732,618,190

Now as long as the criminals don&#8217;t make it obvious they were actually from the city, that one point will be confirmed&#8230;

> Richard Lee, 75, of Creve Coeur was about to count the weekend earnings in his office at the Manchester location along the 14000 block of Manchester Road when two men grabbed his arms and sprayed pepper spray in his face, according to his wife of 46 years, Chi Yang Lee.
> 
> **They then forced him into his car and drove him to Kingshighway Boulevard and Shaw Avenue in St. Louis.** They took his car keys, wallet, about $5,000 in cash and disabled his cellphone, she said.

Dammit. City: 0, County: 23,474,932,729,239,234,324,732,618,191

Kingshighway and Shaw? Were they trying to take him to the _other_ Uncle Bill&#8217;s and just decided they didn&#8217;t think they could handle greasy food at the last second, instead deciding to just head home and get some rest like so many other St. Louis area folks out late at night after a night of regrettable decisions?

> Manchester Police Det. Sgt. Dan Rehm confirmed the reported robbery-kidnapping, but would not release any details.

For most people, just being picked up in Ballwin and driven to the city for anything other than a third inning arrival at Busch Stadium is scary enough, but to have your money taken, phone destroyed and pepper sprayed is crazy. (Usually they don&#8217;t pepper spray you.)
