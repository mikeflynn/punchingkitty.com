Former producer for local sports talk outfit KFNS Ryan Huff has been  sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to&#8230;deep breath&#8230;two felony counts of production of child pornography, one felony count of enticement of a child, one felony count of receipt of child pornography, two felony counts of possession of child pornography and one felony count of transferring obscene material to a minor.  Whew!

In case that&#8217;s not clear enough, lets revisit the initial report from Jan 24th, 2009 on <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/01/24/breaking-kfns-producer-arrested-on-rape-charges/" target="_blank">this very site</a>:

> Apparently Huff met the girls on “an internet chatroom,” which could mean anything since I’m guessing the reporter on the KMOV video I watched doesn’t know the difference between this very site and and actual “internet chatroom.”  After the meeting online, the two went to the movies, on a “date,” and then back to a house where they were joined by _another_ **13 year old** girl.  Shortly after her arrival they started partaking in sexual activity.  Huff’s alleged Playskool Orgy was noticed only after photos were taken and the girls where showing them around school!
> 
> Unfortunately for Huff, current Missouri state and federal laws don’t allow you to add the ages of your simultaneous sexual partners together to try to get a number above 18.

You know sometimes you really want the punishment to fit the crime and in this case it kinda does since we have a feeling Huff is going to be made uncomfortable by an older gentleman soon just like those girls.

What you haven&#8217;t heard what they do in prison?  Its ridiculous&#8230;
