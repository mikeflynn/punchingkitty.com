Tuesday night two homeless gentlemen where arguing downtown near the convention center. They were arguing over who was going to get to eat a bag of Cheetos. Eventually one guy stabbed the other guy. So ends another regular night in St. Louis.

> Homicide detectives in St. Louis are investigating the incident which happened shortly before 9:00 p.m. at 6th and Washington.
> 
> Officials say the knife attack started with an argument over a bag of Cheetos.

This is just crazy. We&#8217;d definitely stab a guy over a bag of Ruffles Sour Cream and Cheddar chips, but Cheetos? Not a fan. Are we talking like a big bag of Cheetos? Do we have on no gloves, regular gloves, or standard homeless guy fingerless gloves? Maybe we&#8217;d put up a fight if we had full gloves and it was a huge bag of Cheetos, like a baby pool full of Cheetos, but we&#8217;re not coming to blows over a &#8220;fun size&#8221;. You can have it. You&#8217;re just gonna have to walk around like an orange-fingered jackass all night, or wash your hands in a puddle.

The victim was taken to the hospital, died a short time later, and never did get any Cheetos. As for the suspect, the police do have a man in custody, but no details have been released at this time outside of the following file photo:
