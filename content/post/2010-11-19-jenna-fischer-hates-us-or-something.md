I know! We can&#8217;t believe it either. Frankly it just hurts so damn much, and we don&#8217;t know what we can do to make the pain go away.

Ok, here&#8217;s the backstory: A few weeks ago the call went out to the various St. Louis media members that hometown girl Jenna Fischer was coming back to St. Louis to accept some award from a whosywhatsit _[Editor&#8217;s Note: She&#8217;s winning the Cinema St. Louis Award]_ because of her acting and also debut her new movie&#8230;&#8221;Pam Gets a New Job&#8221; or something _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Her movie is &#8220;A Little Help&#8221;]_&#8230;to a St. Louis audience. &#8220;Who would like to line up an interview with her?&#8221; The email asked us. &#8220;We would love to!&#8221; we replied! &#8230;hmm, been a little while now, still hadn&#8217;t heard anything, but it&#8217;s only been a few days. Days turned in to a week, and that phone just sat there, not ringing. Well, her people will get a hold of us, we just know it! She&#8217;s a comedic actor from St. Louis after all, total match made in interview heaven&#8230;we better go ahead and just go put on our suit for the interview. [Days later] Still nothing! This suit is starting to stink and we&#8217;ve run out of bad poetry ideas&#8230;also the neighbors must be getting sick of all the late night weeping.Â We&#8217;d given up all hope until we get it rubbed in our faces: <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/11/jenna_fischer_pam_the_office_a_little_help_sliff_stlouis_theoffice.php" target="_blank">Riverfront Times!</a> <a href="http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2010/11/jenna-fischer-talks-to-melissa-from-wamg/" target="_blank">WeAreMovieGeeks.com!</a> <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/joe-williams/article_c01de4b0-f281-11df-accd-00127992bc8b.html" target="_blank">Whoever This Guy is from STLToday!</a> What the hell?! You make us sad Jenna Fischer. Very very sad.

Why don&#8217;t you like us Jenna Fischer?! What did we do? Seriously, you&#8217;re one of only maybe 6 people are consistently nice too (<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/jenna-fischer/" target="_blank">Proof!</a>).

Here, Jenna, we wrote you this haiku:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Jenna no like us<br /> but we are the awesomest<br /> and also very sad

  It totally would have been a fun interview. You would have been all like &#8220;OMG that is such a great question!&#8221; and we would have been like &#8220;Aww, I mean it was OK.&#8221; and then you&#8217;re like &#8220;No, seriously that was awesome, I&#8217;m going to answer the hell out of that thing!&#8221;, then we&#8217;re all &#8220;Awesome.&#8221; and do a hot hair flip thing and do a pec dance, and you would be all &#8220;&#8230;have you ever thought what it would be like if we kissed?&#8221;, and then we&#8217;re totally &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; but all soft and cool like.

  Freaking learned the pec dance thing for nothing!
