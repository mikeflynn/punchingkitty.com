St. Louis is in the midst of a bit of a crime issue&#8230;by which we mean there are areas that people feel kinda safe dotted throughout areas where no one should ever go ever. The Mayor&#8217;s office and the police force only seem able to fill their time complaining about every issue other than actually getting out there and putting a stop to this, while a mass of other politicians and residents like to pretend that everything&#8217;s going great while the population of the city continues to dive.

Missouri State Government to the rescue right?! Wrong. Right now <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_135b0293-597a-563f-8708-71f07749d7a0.html" target="_blank">your Missouri State Senators are waffling back and forth over a simple bill to fix the obvious problem of the complete lack of local police force control by the city government and voters</a>, all the while, <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/article_1352b140-7bf0-11e0-b6fc-001a4bcf6878.html" target="_blank">letting a bill that allows even more people to carry concealed weapons breeze right through</a>.

Tone deaf buttholes.

This is exactly why St. Louis&#8217;s government and therefore, the voters, needs control over their own police force and why a bunch of moron state politicians from areas that have no idea what crime is other than that Wilkenson boy who keeps screwing the chickens and the wrong people to be making decisions about St. Louis. Nothing about having your 21 year old (though the original bill had it at 18), hunting since the age of 4, son to have a conceal and carry permit out in Speedtrap, Missouri&#8230;but in the city, it smells like the beginning of yet another gun fight.

> “In urban areas, guns are a serious safety issue,” said state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-St. Louis.

Chappelle-Nadal was one of the only 6 no votes to the bill. Take note of her home district.

> “Where I live, if you don’t have a gun it’s like you don’t have a car,” &#8211; State Sen. Brian Nieves, R-Washington

There&#8217;s one of the major proponents of the bill responding to Chappelle-Nadal just before offering her to come visit a gun range. Seriously. &#8230;how should we respond to this eloquently? &#8220;Fuck you Brian Nieves. You sound like a dick head that should try moving to North City for a few months.&#8221; is all that&#8217;s coming to mind.

We realize you can&#8217;t make laws at a state level that only make sense to one part of the state, and since having fair representation of a state where even 30 minutes outside the St. Louis City limits puts you in a dramatically different mindset when it comes to crime, we understand the way this vote went down. Maybe you even agree with it, and that&#8217;s fine. _However_, these gun-toting State Senators are the same ones that are screwing around and not letting the city control it&#8217;s own Police Department, and that&#8217;s so wrong it should be criminal. If you want to smile and be a hick asshole to the Senator from St. Louis about how she&#8217;s worried about loosened conceal and carry laws will lead to more violence in her home base, then at least admit that it&#8217;s a dramatically different environment, and let St. Louis do what it can to stem the crime issue.We know it&#8217;s worth screwing around with tax minutiae when you&#8217;re hanging out in Washington, Missouri reading a paper&#8217;s crime blotter than consists entirely of two kids getting drunk in a field and a couple of smashed mailboxes, you aren&#8217;t looking at the real issues here. Twisting the knife by passing a way to get guns in to more young people&#8217;s hands at the same time makes this whole thing stink even more than Kirstie Alley&#8217;s taint after a Dancing With The Stars episode.
