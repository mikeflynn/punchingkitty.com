KMOX has a source that tells them St. Louis Police Chief Dan Isom might be mulling an opportunity to leave his glamorous post as the lead protector of the city and take a job teaching at the university level. We&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;d be teaching art because you don&#8217;t get to be St. Louis&#8217; top cop without getting really good at tracing bodies in chalk.

A reporter for KMOX caught up to Chief Isom in an attempt to confirm the report, but he was met with an &#8220;artfully vague&#8221; response. Too bad for KMOX, they don&#8217;t have our Translate-o-Matron 39958490!

> “I’m going to continue to work hard every day until I walk out of here,”

_Peace the hell out bitches!_

> &#8220;Who knows what our future is&#8230;&#8221;

_Who knows?! I could get hit by a bus tomorrow! &#8230;but I&#8217;ve tried to make that happen for years now, so I&#8217;m giving up on that dream and instead I&#8217;m going to try to get a new job._

> &#8220;&#8230;so I’m working hard to make sure that we do what we need to do to address crime in the city of St. Louis and serve the citizens of St. Louis.&#8221;

_I promise to not let the crime get any worse while I try to get the hell out of here. I feel pretty safe in saying that because&#8230;I mean&#8230;it just doesn&#8217;t seem possible as long as no more cute white college kids get car jacked._

> &#8220;Well, as I said, nobody knows what their future is around here, but my focus is making sure I’m addressing issues within the city of St. Louis&#8221;

_Nobody knows what their future holds. Hell, you could get shanked on the way home after this interview&#8230;seriously! Watch out man! Which way are you planning on driving? You don&#8217;t by chance have a helicopter do you?_

Mayor Slay was said to have been caught off-guard with the report but said Chief Isom&#8230;

> &#8220;&#8230;still has (my) full confidence for the job he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;

_Finally! How many bull shit LinkedIn references do you have to write for a guy before he starts getting some response?!_

Oh, sorry Mayor Slay. Totally forgot to turn the translator off. Our bad.
