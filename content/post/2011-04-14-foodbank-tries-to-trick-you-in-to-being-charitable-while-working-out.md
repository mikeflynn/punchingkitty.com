Nice try **St. Louis Area Foodbank**. Here&#8217;s where you messed up in your little trick to get people to be charitable by saying lifting canned goods are working out: We don&#8217;t want to do either of those things! In. Your. Face.

> The organization also aims to demonstrate the physical benefits of volunteering at nonprofit organizations throughout St. Louis and is encouraging people to sign up for the &#8220;Pound for Pound Challenge,&#8221; a free online weight loss program that raises money for Feeding America.

A program that tries to get you to lose weight, only to raise funds so that others can _gain_ weight? Feels like there&#8217;s an optimization here that involves liposuction and poor people overcoming any gag reflex they may have left. Can&#8217;t be that hard though, seeing as most people give creamed spiniach to food drives, &#8220;rich guy ass fat&#8221; can&#8217;t be much worse. The trick is to always call it by the French translation: _riche cul grassouillet_ which sounds a lot nicer and seems to have worked for escargot.
