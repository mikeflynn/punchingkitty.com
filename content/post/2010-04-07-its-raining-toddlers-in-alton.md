Yesterday in Alton, IL a three-year old body walked over to an open second story window with no screen and fell out on to a concrete slab below.

> A three-year-old boy had to be rushed to the hospital Tuesday afternoon after falling from the second-story window of his family&#8217;s apartment.
> 
> According to Captain Williams of the Alton Fire Department, the incident happened at 1:40 p.m. at an apartment complex in the 300 block of Mitchell Street

He is still listed in critical condition, but initial cognitive tests are proving that the toddler still has a chance to be one of the smarter Illinois to Missouri commuters. Meaning he will be able to drive at a decent and steady speed while keeping his rusted out car in only the one lane instead of constantly weaving in to other lanes or tapping his breaks the whole time we have to follow him to the point where you swear he is driving all the way to our house with his ugly pale blue Land  of Lincoln license plate mocking you with its ugliness!
