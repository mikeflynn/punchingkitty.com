Somehow no one was injured and the people in car have been arrested. No suprise there. Smashing something that hard in to Hooters ususal does end up getting you arrested&#8230;at the very least slapped.

That&#8217;s gotta be the first time anything &#8220;flaming&#8221; crashed a party at Hooters!

We hear the car was initially headed down south, but got distracted by the Hooters and ended up just busting it right there. Damn shame. We hear that can happen to guys occasionally.

The only way this accident could be more funny is if somehow a motorboat crashed through the Hooters instead.
