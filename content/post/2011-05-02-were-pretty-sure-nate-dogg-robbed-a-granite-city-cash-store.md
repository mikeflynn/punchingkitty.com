Ok, ok you&#8217;re pretty sure Nate Dogg&#8217;s dead right? We were too&#8230;until&#8230;seriously, hang in there with us for a second&#8230;we saw this security camera still taken from the Granite City, Illinois _Advanced America Cash Advance_ (Where the second &#8220;advance&#8221; means advance!) store.

&#8230;and then remembered this:

No word on Eazy E&#8217;s status as of yet, but he had AIDS&#8230;and um&#8230;AIDS even takes out zombies we figure, so he might just still be dead. We&#8217;s use our vast investigative network to double check, but dude&#8230;AIDS. He&#8217;s dead. Trust us he&#8217;s dead. Nate Dogg: Pretty sure he&#8217;s alive now and robbing stores in western Illinois, Eazy E: Still dead with the AIDS.

To be fair, we can&#8217;t really be sure because even if the police catch these perpetrators who escaped in their car with an undetermined amount of cash, they* all look the same anyway.

* they = Guys in suits, you racist.
