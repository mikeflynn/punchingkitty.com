_<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/battle/" target="_blank">Battle of the Blades</a>_ is to Canada what _Dancing with the Stars_ is to America. The differences being &#8220;Blads&#8221; is hockey players instead of D-list celebrities and it&#8217;s on ice. So what about Canada? Well former St. Louis Blues badass **Kelly Chase** is on this season.

If you thought for a second that he&#8217;s dancing with Michelle Kwan, you&#8217;re a racist. If you thought Not-Michelle Kwan was dancing with <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/view_316504_1_1233547447.jpeg?page=1" target="_blank">late-ninetiesÂ Brenda Warner</a>, we don&#8217;t blame you.

Dancing to Whitesnake&#8217;s &#8220;Here I Go Again&#8221; Yahoo Sports&#8217; recap says of their latest dance:

> They pull off a smooth skate highlighted by a huge one-handed lift, complete with fist-pump. What, no headbanging? Judge Sandra praises Kelly&#8217;s &#8220;nuance and emotion.&#8221; No need to drop the gloves tonight.

Sounds like Kelly isn&#8217;t doing all that bad and they are certainly doing better than the pairing of Anabelle Langlois and ex-NHLer Georges Laraque who ended up with 12 stitches after an ill-fated practice:

Good luck Chaser!
