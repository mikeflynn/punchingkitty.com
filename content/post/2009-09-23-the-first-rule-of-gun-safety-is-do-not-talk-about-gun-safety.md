[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1780" title="Homer-Gun-1.jpeg" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Homer-Gun-1.jpeg.gif" alt="Homer-Gun-1.jpeg" width="210" height="199" />][1]James Looney (no, not the [Dodgers player][2].  He only has one &#8216;o&#8217;.) decided to show his girlfriend how to use a gun the other day.  Clearly the lesson plan wasn&#8217;t sinking in, so this teaching revolutionary decided the best way to show her how to not use a gun was the kill himself.

Best lesson plan of all time!  You can only use it the one time though.

> The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office says a firearm safety demonstration turned deadly Friday when a 40-year-old Imperial man accidentally shot and killed himself.
> 
> Police say James Looney of the 4300 block of Rock Valley court was teaching his girlfriend about firearm safety when h**e put a gun to his head and asked her if it would go off**. Police say **h****e did this with two other weapons** and varied safety mechanisms before the last one went off, said Lt. Dave Marshak.

The police believe alcohol was involved.  Also, we&#8217;re guessing, inbreeding at some point.
