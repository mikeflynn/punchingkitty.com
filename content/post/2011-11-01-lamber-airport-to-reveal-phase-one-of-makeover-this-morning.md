We know you&#8217;re excited! The remodels baggage carousels now feature higher ceilings and more light, but fair warning, they couldn&#8217;t get rid of that religious guy and his little desk who thinks he&#8217;s better than you because he knows Jesus&#8230;or satan or Tom Cruise. We&#8217;ve actually never stopped to ask him.

> Lambert officials removed the construction walls Sunday night and by Tuesday morning, travelers will be able to exit the Concourse C-D security checkpoint and catch a close-up glimpse of what the airport is striving to accomplish over the next year.
> 
> The height of the ceiling has been raised about 10 inches. But the recessed and circular &#8220;cove&#8221; lighting gives it an even more open feel.

Also exciting is Lambert&#8217;s work in replacing all the Grade B/BB plywood with all new A/B grade plywood. It looks really nice. Not &#8220;replacing the f*cking windows eight months later&#8221; but still really really nice.

> &#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day,&#8221; [Lambert Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge] said. &#8220;For the last three months, we&#8217;ve gone through the heaviest phase of construction in this whole project. &#8230; We had the long detour where customers coming in off the D Concourse had to exit through the B.&#8221;

Not sure how to tell Rhonda this, but those people weren&#8217;t grumbling about having to exit at the B concourse, they were just grumbling about exiting in St. Louis through crappy airport. You should have unveiled the changes yesterday and announced the place is haunted (and then whisper &#8220;with weird people, grumpy TSA agents and fat guys that can&#8217;t figure out the departure drop off zone.&#8221;)
