A 5-year-old Collinsville boy was wandering around next to busy streets after being dropped off at the wrong stop by his bus driver after he was never supposed to be on the bus after school in the first place.

It&#8217;s probably the kid&#8217;s fault though. He washed off his &#8220;no bus&#8221; hand stamp and replaced it with &#8220;Side of the road with no adults around even though I&#8217;m 5.&#8221; Kid&#8217;s got some huge hands.

> “He was like ‘they just left me,’” recalled [his mother, Chantel Sells]. “And I’m like ‘who?’ And he said ‘the bus driver just left me and I was walking by myself.’”
> 
> She was instead told her son accidentally got put on the bus and then got dropped off at the wrong bus stop.

&#8220;Which stop are you waiting for son?&#8221;

&#8220;My mom said she was supposed to pick me up from school.&#8221;

&#8220;&#8230;ok, so just anywhere then? Oh look, here it is!&#8221;

> Collinsville School District Superintendent Robert Green said he did not even know what had happened until News 4 contacted him hours later.
> 
> “It could have been much worse and we’re thankful the boy was found and is OK,” said Green.

It also could be have been a lot better, but the Collinsville bus route doesn&#8217;t drop off anywhere near a Chuck E. Cheese or the Missouri border.

Keep in mind, this was the kid&#8217;s first day of school. Ever. So this morning, when he undoubtedly complains about having to go back and claims &#8220;Every one hates me there!&#8221; remember, he&#8217;s got a fair bit of evidence on his side. How&#8217;s about a big bag of cookies for breakfast today Junior? We want you nice and wild for those nice attentive teachers you have. Oh and don&#8217;t forget you&#8217;re new &#8220;I&#8217;M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE DAMN BUS&#8221; t-shirt mommy made you last night!
