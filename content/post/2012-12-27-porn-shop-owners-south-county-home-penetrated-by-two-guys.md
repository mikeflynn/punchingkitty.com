According to St. Louis County Police reports, two armed men broke in to the home of the owners of multiple &#8220;adult entertainment businesses&#8221; in the area, stealing cash and injuring both victims.

> The intruders beat up the husband and wife at their home on the 4400 block of Forder Ridge in south St. Louis County, according to police, and stole an undisclosed amount of cash. The victims were treated for minor injuries at an area hospital. Police are unsure if they are still hospitalized.

So ok, slow down. Two guys rammed their way in to the home of a porn entrepreneur? Sounds like something they should be pretty familiar with. How did it go down? Did one guy come in the front and the other in the back door? Did they high five after? &#8230;or did they both squeeze in the back door? Maybe one came in garage door, but then the other guy shocked them by coming in through the back porch? The possibilities are so endless they could fill several shelves in a smallish room in the back corner past the action movies behind one of those bead curtains that you can see through pretty easily for a second.

> Investigators say the attack was not random, and that the victims were specifically targeted.

Well yeah&#8230;if you run around in a store like that it&#8217;s like maybe you want it a little.

_[Editor&#8217;s Note: Of course, we hope they recover quickly and the cops catch the perpetrators.]_
