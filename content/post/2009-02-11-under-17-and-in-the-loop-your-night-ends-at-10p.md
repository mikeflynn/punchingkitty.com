The University City city council recently approved the move to make the curfew for those under 18 years old 10 pm every night.  This is a change of one hour on the weekdays and a full 2 hours on the weekends where the curfew used to be midnight.  

[According to The Post Dispatch][1], Joe Edwards, Loop Godfather, approves of the move:

>  Joe Edwards, representing the Loop Special Business District, told the council that young visitors would still be able to catch a movie at the Tivoli and get an ice cream afterward.
> 
> &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot they can do in the daytime and early evening hours,&#8221; Edwards said. &#8220;If they can just have patience until they&#8217;re 21 &#8230; they&#8217;ll reap the benefits. &#8220;

Now if you want to get all technical about it, the curfew only pertains to the University City part of &#8220;The Loop&#8221; so if you are 17 and just don&#8217;t want to go home, head east on Delmar and go to [that shitty looking grocery store that for some reason sells pizza on Delmar and Hamilton][2].  

Laugh if you want, but U. City councilman Michael Glickert apparently agrees with me!

> &#8220;At 10 o&#8217;clock, the kids will move east in the Loop to the city of St. Louis, which has a different curfew.&#8221; [Glickert] said the curfews should have been coordinated with St. Louis.

Yup.  Get ready for some crazy 10:15 pm business shitty looking grocery store that for some reason sells pizza on Delmar and Hamilton!
