Back in November we mentioned that apart from how stupid 101 ESPN&#8217;s fake &#8220;contest&#8221; to be Bryan Burwell&#8217;s new co-host, we thought the recently canned JC Corcoran had the job.

We were wrong about that. We were dead on however that <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/11/09/comparing-101-espns-shadowy-host-to-jc-corcorans-head/" target="_blank">the shadowy head used in WXOS&#8217; banners promoting the &#8220;search&#8221; were a perfect match for Corcoran</a>. Recently even the man himself, JC, agreed on the July 2nd installment of his &#8220;Daily Dose&#8221; segment on <a href="http://www.jcontheline.com/v2/index.php" target="_blank">JCOnTheLine.com</a> which we&#8217;ve embedded below and cued to the pertinent parts (assuming YouTube cooperates, which if it doesn&#8217;t, [go here to watch it on YouTube cued up][1].)



Thanks for the shout JC. Glad to hear you agree, since if anyone should be able to recognize your head it&#8217;s you.
