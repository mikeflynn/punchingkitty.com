Parking tickets are a good revenue stream for the city, but what happens when people aren&#8217;t violating parking rules enough? If only we could make them think it was ok to park there and then say it wasn&#8217;t so they&#8217;d have to give us money?

_[ Scene: St. Louis City Budget Meeting]_

**Mayor Slay:** We need more money! The damn cops keep asking for more, we can&#8217;t cut any more services, we&#8217;re hemorrhaging people and we our plan to dig up and move North St. Louis with 100 helicopters over to Illinois still isn&#8217;t a viable option. We need money and you are my best idea men! Go!

**Chip**: We could start taxing the price of moving vans!

**Slay**: Hmm&#8230;not bad. What else?

**Mitch**: What if we get more parking fine?

**Slay**: How are we supposed to do that?

**Mitch**: Well what if we go a street where you can park on the street in the middle of the day and then put up a bunch of no parking signs so that later on meter maids can come through and make all those people give us money?

**Slay**: Really? Seriously?! I can not believe you would even suggest something so&#8230;utterly amazing! OMG! Lets go do it right now! I love you Mitch!

 _[Cut to Grand yesterday morning]_ 

> Motorists who parked at the Grand Boulevard Metro Station Thursday morning came back this afternoon to find tickets on their cars.
> 
> The city is banning parking, due to up-coming construction on the Grand Boulevard bridge.
> 
> The problem is the no-parking signs weren&#8217;t there this morning. Even construction workers were ticketed.

_[&#8230;back to the meeting.]_

**Mitch**: I love you too sir! &#8230;if this doesn&#8217;t work, we can try hanging a magnifying glass on the Arch and burn up East St. Louis like an ant!

**Slay**: What would that do for our revenues?

**Mitch**: What? Oh..nothing I guess.

**Slay**: Ok. Lets put that idea in the maybe pile anyway.

Yes&#8230;the ticket thing seriously happend, though admittedly maybe not quite as we have portrayed it here.  (It was probably totally close to that though!)
