Today&#8217;s winner is on Perry Crawford who&#8230;

> &#8230;is facing charges for burglary, assault, possession of a controlled substance and resisting arrest. Police say he burglarized a home in Wright City, Mo. on July 7 and assaulted on officer.

&#8230;and then apparently recieved the same pillow in prison that we have at home since we too wake up with a full loop on the top of our heads some times. The gross legions must have been caused by his mattress&#8230;or his fight with the police&#8230;or AIDS. Either way, he&#8217;s really freaking out our friend &#8220;surprised cat&#8221;.
