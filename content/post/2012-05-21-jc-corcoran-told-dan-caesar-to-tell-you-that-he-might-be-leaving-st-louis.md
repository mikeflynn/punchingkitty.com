Dan Caesar handles the local sports media beat for the Post Dispatch because it&#8217;s a super important thing to cover and people are too scared and creeped out to get close enough to fire him (right).

Last week Caesar sat down with <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/04/27/jc-corcoran-fired-trish-gazall-quits-ktrs/" target="_blank">the recently fired JC Corcoran</a>, who spent the whole time telling Caesar that he&#8217;s totally going to leave town. He swears&#8230;yup, totally going to happen so don&#8217;t try to stop him. Here he goes&#8230;he&#8217;s leaving&#8230;for reals&#8230;one last chance to stop him&#8230;&#8217;cause it&#8217;s happening with all the job offers he hasn&#8217;t taken&#8230;

> &#8220;We sold our house last Saturday in anticipation of most likely leaving&#8221; [Corcoran] said. &#8220;If anyone (locally) has anything to say, I&#8217;d encourage them to speak up because all the discussion I am having are from out-of-town stations. There don&#8217;t seem to be any (decent) opportunities in St. Louis.&#8221;

> Corcoran said. &#8220;&#8230; I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;m in a position that I have to take a tertiary-level position just to remain working in St. Louis. I&#8217;m having discussion with some pretty big stations in pretty big cities. Nothing&#8217;s on the table yet, but I am led to believe there will be soon. If nobody in St. Louis steps forward and offers something, I&#8217;m going to go.&#8221;

K bye! :)

Nothing&#8217;s more newsworthy than an afternoon DJ leaving town, but lets see if we can find something to top it and save this story&#8230;hey look, an albino zebra!
