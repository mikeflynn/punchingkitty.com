> Last Thursday afternoon I got a call from Brian Bartow, the St. Louis Cardinals&#8217; director of media relations. Bartow said the team had seen and loved the_Riverfront Times Guide to All-Star Week_, a special supplement this paper had published the previous day &#8212; all except the part where we revealed the home addresses of some current and former Redbirds luminaries.
> 
> The players, Bartow said, were particularly peeved, especially Pujols. So upset were they, Bartow told me, that the ballclub felt it had no option but to instruct Major League Baseball to revoke the credentials they&#8217;d granted _Riverfront Times_to cover the All-Star Game, and to rescind our credentials to cover the team over the course of the regular season.

Finkel goes on to mention what was our initial thought on the subject, that this information is really easily attainable from public records, but I&#8217;m betting that doesn&#8217;t make Pujols feel any better.

As with most posts like this, the article is fun, the comments are better&#8230;god bless comments.

> A deranged racist once threatened to kill Derek Jeter and other black players. How would your second-rate publication feel if it contributed to a crime by giving some nut a road map?

> Here&#8217;s hoping you never get credentialed again. Amateurs.

Dudes named Abe are always grouchy.  I bet Lincoln was grouchy.

> Seely [says][4]:

> I covered the Cardinals a few years ago for the RFT, and the surliest player in the locker room was none other than Pujols. Now, granted, that may have been his pregame psych-up ritual, but the dude hardly has a saintly demeanor, devout as he is.

I&#8217;ve heard that all the great ball players were in some way kinda dicky (with the exception of Musial).

Why do all conversations in this town seemingly have to eventually involve a guy that goes by &#8220;Big Joe&#8221;?
