Boo!_] St. Louis&#8217; only Gay/Lesbian/Transgender newspaper is shutting its doors until 2010.

> Voice publisher and owner, **Pam Schneider**, tells _Daily RFT_ that she decided to shutdown the paper for the rest of the year to concentrate on a redesign of the publication.

> &#8220;It just made sense to take the time and money we need to focus on coming out in 2010 the way we want,&#8221; she says.

Too bad that its come to this, but good to hear they will be coming back in a few months, but haven&#8217;t they learned nothing from Cher?!  You aren&#8217;t supposed to pre-announce your return, you are just supposed to do it all of a sudden&#8230;[with auto-tune][3].

[_Editor&#8217;s Note: Ok, we are over it now. We love the RFT_.]
