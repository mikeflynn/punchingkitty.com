Just remember: For every guy in an ironic t-shirt with think black glasses and a waxed mustache telling you how the world is changing for the better with every tweet about your &#8220;personal brand&#8221;, we&#8217;re also getting worse for every stupid ghetto fight over food stamps that gets posted to YouTube.

Don&#8217;t get us wrong, we love a good YouTube fight, but still&#8230;no one&#8217;s making the world a better place through social media with this shit.

> The nearly three-minute video, which was recorded on a cell phone, shows at least four women fighting at the [Department of Human Services] office located at Missouri and 9th.
> 
> Two women can be seen holding onto each other as a third punches one of them in the back of the head.
> 
> At one point, one of the women walks across the office and punches another in the face.
> 
> According to officials, the women involved had been waiting to get food stamps when the fists started to fly.

You can see the fight <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QbZ0HmiXhU" target="_blank">here on YouTube</a>&#8230;oh no! They took the video down! &#8230;oh wait <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOKAUHXaoIE" target="_blank">here it is</a>. Someone already reposted it. Love you internet! <3 ;)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/jOKAUHXaoIE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Clearly the social norm when witnessing a fight of this magnitude is to continually yell &#8220;Beat her ass!&#8221; over and over again. It&#8217;s the same in the UK as well, you  just need to have your pinky up while you&#8217;re yelling.

One of the DHS employees had a theory for all the anger:

> “If you’re not upset, you’ll be upset leaving up out of there,” said Jenine Nixon. “You straight have to have love in your heart to stand there all day.”

The system works! You don&#8217;t deserve the food stamps if you don&#8217;t have love in your heart.
