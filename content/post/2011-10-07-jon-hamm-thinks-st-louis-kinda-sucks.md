> It&#8217;s a good town to be from and a good place to be a kid&#8230;but it&#8217;s very much a place where when you grow up you either work for your dad or you leave town.
> 
> There&#8217;s not a lot of innovation happening in St. Louis.
> 
> For whatever reason, I always wanted to get out of that place.

Well thanks a lot Jon Hamm! Maybe come visit some time before you go blabbing about St. Louis from your lofty Hollywood perch. &#8220;Oh I play a guy from the 60s in a tv show on a channel called American Movie Classics! I think I&#8217;m special even though it makes no sense for a TV show to be on a channel named that.&#8221; Â That shit makes no sense and you know it Jon! No innovation?! Maybe you&#8217;ve heard of <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a>, one of the hottest start-ups on that internet thing, <del>and it has an office in St. Louis</del>. _[Editor&#8217;s Note: &#8230;ok, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">used</span> to have an office in St. Louis. You&#8217;ve won this round Hamm!]_ Or maybe you&#8217;re reading this blog. A site that innovates it&#8217;s ass off every single day! Like the other night, when this girl wouldn&#8217;t give us her number, and was frankly a bit rude, we just innovated over to her Facebook page and then just waited in the bushes outside her house. We watched her watch TV and eat a Hot Pocket for a while, then ripped some of our hair out and fed it to her dog so a part of us could be in her house and maybe hump the couch. Then we left, killing a homeless guy on the way home just to feel something. Oh and you think we did that just because our dad did Jon Hamm? Well that happens to simply be a coincidence!

Later on Hamm talks about how he taught The Office&#8217;s **Ellie Kemper** drama while she was in a St. Louis high school and he was a 24 year old teacher&#8217;s assistant. Here&#8217;s a picture of the Bridesmaids star so no matter what you like, everyone has an opportunity to look a little too long at a picture in this post.
