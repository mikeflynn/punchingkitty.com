_[Editor&#8217;s Note: Ok, so we were pretty sure Pujols was going to the Marlins a few days ago when we made this, and then when we went to edit it we realized that the Angels really don&#8217;t have a mascot per se&#8230;so now you&#8217;ve got this. The point is still the same right? Makes sense still&#8230;they have fish in California&#8230;and they get to be Angels too one would assume. Whatever. Shut up!]_
