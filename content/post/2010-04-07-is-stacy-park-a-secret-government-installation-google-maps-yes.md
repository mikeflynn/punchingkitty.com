We&#8217;ve been there and we just say a playground and a baseball diamond. We didn&#8217;t even notice the huge cement installation with the words &#8220;DANGER KEEP OFF&#8221; written on it.

What you don&#8217;t believe me? Ask my friend Google Maps. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=stacy+park,+MO&sll=38.608822,-90.234339&sspn=0.007981,0.014076&ie=UTF8&hq=Stacy+Park&hnear=Stacy+Park,+Olivette,+MO+63132&ll=38.671539,-90.391989&spn=0.003987,0.007038&t=h&z=17" target="_blank">He&#8217;ll show you</a>.

So what the hell is going on here? We looked around and these satellite photos don&#8217;t appear to be all that old. What the hell did Google take a photo of and use for Stacy Park? &#8230;or did we just uncover where they buried the alien landing from a few years back that produced the perma-happy KMOV&#8217;s white Al Roker <a href="http://www.kmov.com/great-day-st-louis/about/Matt-Chambers-Great-Day-Bio-69685167.html" target="_blank">Matt Chambers</a>.

Look, we don&#8217;t care that you think he&#8217;d be nice in real life, no one can be _that_ happy working on Great Day St. Louis. He&#8217;s gotta be a lizard under than human mask!

Oh excuse us. There&#8217;s a black van that just rolled up to the Punching Kitty HQ. This will just be a second. Wait what?! Take your hands off me! Don&#8217;t tell me to stop typing! Oh like that black hood is going to stop me&#8230;you&#8217;re going to need something stronger than that to take me down! Oh that club might do the tri&#8230;
