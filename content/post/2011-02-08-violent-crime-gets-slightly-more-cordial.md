Some people like coffee, but who are we to judge?

> According to the victim, he and the suspect got into an argument around 1 a.m. on the 4100 block of Enright. The suspect, 28, then took out a gun and fired at the victim, striking him in the leg.

Well that wasn&#8217;t very cool.

> The suspect dropped the victim off at an area hospital where he was listed in serious condition.

Aw. Well he didn&#8217;t have to do that! Awfully nice if you think about it.

&#8230;had to be one awkward drive to the hospital though. What do you even say? You aren&#8217;t a happy camper with your leg shot up, but if you get all pissy about it he&#8217;ll just drop your ass off wherever, which would be a tough walk. Oh the other hand, stopping for gas seemed like pushing it. &#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m going in to pay. You need anything? More paper towels maybe? &#8230; Hey! &#8230;eh, I&#8217;ll just go get you some paper towels. Oh! And they have the good coffee here!&#8221;

The police are still looking for the suspect, who is related to the victim.
