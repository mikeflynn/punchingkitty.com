Confused?  We got the following automated direct message from John (@pertzfox) today:

<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-03-at-11.45.17-PM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1622" title="Screen shot 2009-09-03 at 11.45.17 PM" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-03-at-11.45.17-PM.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2009-09-03 at 11.45.17 PM" width="520" height="81" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-03-at-11.45.17-PM.jpg 520w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-03-at-11.45.17-PM-300x46.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a>

We had to decline.  But not because we don&#8217;t love John, and [his behind the scenes youtube-ing][2],  but because we just aren&#8217;t comfortable owing any favors to the Pertzborn mafia family.  Sure he looks nice on TV, but that guy will break your hands for no reason at all, and snap your neck if you give him one.  What you didn&#8217;t hear about what he did to Victoria Babu that one time?  She does radio now&#8230;enough said.
