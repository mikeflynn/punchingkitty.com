What could be called nothing other than a whoopin&#8217;, the Rams got dropped by the Titans yesterday. Once again we go to the only player that&#8217;s worth a damn on the Rams, Steve Jackson.

Steven, since being the only offensive weapon on the Rams all season, you&#8217;ve had pretty much every member of your opposition&#8217;s defense up your ass every Sunday, yet  you are fighting through the pain and putting up amazing numbers. The real question is, after all that work, how does a kick in the jimmy like the Titan&#8217;s game make you feel?

The slow process of SJ39 turning in to Mean Joe Green might just be complete.
