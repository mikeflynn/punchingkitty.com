The fine folks at **Draftmark** have once again supplied the Punching Kitty headquarters with some beer, this time just in time for July 4th, and we&#8217;d like to thank them for that.

This time we got to try the new Amberbock refill, and we can report the beer was beery, the draft was drafty and urine doesn&#8217;t come out of good rugs we got as a present. &#8220;Blotting&#8221; was woefully ineffective.

In addition to the Amberbock refill, they have also added a Shock Top Wheat IPA, and even better, a &#8220;gel pack&#8221; that you freeze and then drape over the Draftmark to keep it cold while out of the fridge&#8230;like say at a 4th party, or maybe on a desk next to a laptop.

Thanks Draftmark! You&#8217;ve got a great idea that&#8217;s been executed very well so far, and thanks for making St. Louis one of your testbeds!
