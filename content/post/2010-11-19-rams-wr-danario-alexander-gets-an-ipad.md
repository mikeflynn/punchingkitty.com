You know they might end up selling a few of these iPads. Sure sales have been &#8220;slow&#8221; up until now, but with the release of the new promotional shot with hobbled Rams wide receiver Danario Alexander that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/trent714/status/5455163317821440" target="_blank">was tweeted out last night</a> Apple should be prepping for a real sales crush.

On the way out of the store Danario, the former Mizzou wide out and frequent <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/d_alexander84" target="_blank">Twitterer</a>, was nice enough to pose with his new purchase for the employees and then walked out the door, turned right and torn a tendon in his knee. It&#8217;s ok though, before the iPad could hit the floor, fellow Rams receiver Danny &#8220;Scrappy + White = STL God&#8221; Amendola caught it, thus saving the day yet again.
