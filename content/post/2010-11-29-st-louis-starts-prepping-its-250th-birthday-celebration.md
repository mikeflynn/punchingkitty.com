St. Louis&#8217; 250th birthday isn&#8217;t until 2014, but that&#8217;s just around the corner when you are planning a big ass quarter-millenia bash!

> Missouri History Museum president Robert Archibald is leading the planning group preparing for the 2014 commemoration. Archibald says the goal is to organize a commemoration that includes the entire region.

Alright! Lets all get together and celebrate the fact that our home will be 250 years old. We may not see 300, but that&#8217;s ok, we&#8217;re old and old people/cities can do all kinds of crazy stuff like being <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/11/22/st-louis-regains-title-of-most-dangerous-city/" target="_blank">#1 in violent crime</a>, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/11/24/st-louis-12th-in-gonorrhea-2nd-in-chlamydia/" target="_blank">#2 in Chlamydia, #12 in Gonorrhea</a> and #1 in hairy backed people deciding to wear mesh shirts in public places. People still get grossed out and w0n&#8217;t touch us, but they&#8217;ll just pat us on the arm and say &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s ok. How long has it been since you&#8217;ve been changed?&#8221;

> He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the working name for the celebration is &#8220;STL250,&#8221; though that may change.

&#8220;STL250&#8221;?! That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve come up with? &#8230;oh it may change? Why is that? Maybe because all you did was take the widely used city initials and slam the age against it&#8217;s ass. If it took you longer than 1 second to think of that then we aren&#8217;t holding a lot of hope that this celebration will be any more than a **Fair St. Louis** in February. Hey, do you think we can get **Sammy Hagar** to play the event? What about **Sheryl Crow** or **Dr. Zhivegas**? They never play here. What a treat that would be. Maybe take this whole idea way outside the box and put the Arch on the logo! In fact, where calling it:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8026" title="stl250_logo" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/11/stl250_logo.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="187" />][1]

Lets&#8217; all remember to come back here and check to see how close we got sometime around mid-2013. We don&#8217;t have a lot of hope that we nailed the slogan, but we have high hopes for the all too simple and obvious logo.

Who knows, maybe this will turn out to be a good time. We hear they&#8217;re pulling out all the stops and plan on renting out Chicago so we can have the party somewhere nice.
