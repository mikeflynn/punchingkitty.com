[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6523" title="Lambert" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/08/1365719770071305139S425x425Q85.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]Next spring, Lambert Airport will install two art pieces in both the A and C concourses consisting of a series of glass panels. Here&#8217;s hoping some pink glass will make you smile after you just <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/07/lambert-airport-to-get-full-body-scanners/" target="_blank">refused the invasive naked scanners</a> and were thusly molested by a short sweaty fat guy with an attitude in a uniform two times too small.

> &#8220;The nine art glass screens will make a bold statement and have a very strong visual presence,&#8221; McGuire said.

These nine pieces of colored glass are not to be confused with the two-way mirrors in the office where they take you to be detained because you wouldn&#8217;t take your socks off or let a TSA officer frisk your 3-year-old child.

Now that we mention it, the security checkpoints is probably where they should be putting the most art. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you could just look over at a mural of clouds, rolling green hills and people flying happily to their destination, taking your mind off the winged metal tube full of rape victims you&#8217;ll be swished in to with no food or drink for the next two hours while the only movie choice is _Daddy Day Camp._
