Lil Wayne played the St. Louis portion of his tour last night and according to his Twitter, he took off for a local skate park right after the show, which is actually pretty damn cool. He&#8217;s not very good though, and busted the hell out of his head proving once again that dreads and metal teeth aren&#8217;t as protective as they might appear.

The important part of all of this is that he &#8220;luvs&#8221; us&#8230;granted he hit his head pretty hard so that might have been a factor, but we&#8217;ll take it! &#8220;St. Louis: Lil Wayne Luvs Us&#8221; will be on billboards and car bumpers around the area in no time.
