The Rams had to win and they did, despite their usual lame offensive coaching when they get even the smallest of leads.

Sam Bradford led the charge with 292 yards, going 28 for 37 with 1 touchdown and no interceptions, all while breaking Peyton Manning&#8217;s 12-year old record for NFL rookie completions.

> &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s pretty cool,&#8221; Bradford said of the record. &#8220;I&#8217;m all fired up about the win. If you don&#8217;t get excited for a game like this, you&#8217;re probably in the wrong business.&#8221;

On the other side of the field though, the 49ers looked craptacular as ever with their head coaching spending more time yelling at today&#8217;s starting quarterback than making any meaningful adjustments. After dropping to 5-10 despite having the most talent in the NFC Western division, there is little chance Mike Singletary returns&#8230;maybe if he had a little bigger cross around his neck during the game&#8230;or if he tried not sucking.

Also, nicely done by the Rams to let this special kid on to the field during the game:

You sure do sport. You sure do.
