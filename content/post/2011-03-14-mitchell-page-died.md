Though it is worth pointing out, since no one else seems to, that Page was relieved from his position as hitting coach after the 2004 season because of a drinking problem and was said to <del>have been pushed</del> checked himself in to a rehab facility shortly after. It&#8217;s not known of his alcohol problem and his recent death are related, but 59 is pretty young to be going in your sleep without &#8220;help&#8221; from other issues.

Page was a former Rookie of the Year in 1977 and was the hitting instructor from 2001-2004. He enjoyed stuffing his afro in to a hat so that the sides would squish out, wearing glasses a little too small for his head and having facial hair designs usually reserved for relief pitchers.
