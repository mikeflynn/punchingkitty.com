&#8230;this photo of Tony La Russa trying to put on a Sam Bradford jersey before the Rams took on the Saints!

We&#8217;re not sure if TLR was going for a a Edmonds-style half-shirt thing here, or after being in baseball for so long he&#8217;s completely incapable of putting on a jersey that doesn&#8217;t button down the front.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10988" title="Tony La Russa" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/10/larussa_rams_jersey.jpeg" alt="" width="364" height="512" />][1]**Update:** Woah! &#8230;and Tony just retired. Wow. Apparently that jersey was really a bitch to take off too.
