To the winners go the spoils&#8230;assuming the winners is us <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/01/26/thanks-rft-were-the-best-local-celebrity-site/" target="_blank">being selected as the Best Local Celebrity Blog by the RFT</a> and spoils mean being discussed on <a href="http://www.kmov.com/great-day-st-louis/Best-of-the-Web-114585049.html" target="_blank">KMOV&#8217;s Great Day St. Louis</a>.



They get to us at the end, and we didn&#8217;t get a screen shot because we used naughty language in our post earlier today. Oh well.

The important thing is that Virginia Kerr is a good sport! We don&#8217;t particularly care if our &#8220;targets&#8221; don&#8217;t get the joke, but it sure is nice when they do. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with the post she&#8217;s talking about, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/15/kmovs-virginia-kerr-had-her-baby-told-twitter-all-about-it" target="_blank">you can read it here</a>. Scroll to the end for the sexy Larry Connors action!

It&#8217;s not just Kerr though, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/great-day-in-st-louis/" target="_blank">we have always had a fondness for Great Day St. Louis</a> and have discussed it a few times, so to hear our name on that show was a pleasant surprise to say the least. We still think <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/11/05/east-alton-police-find-human-remains-in-east-alton/" target="_blank">Matt Chambers has to be the devil</a>, but we&#8217;re also really happy we got the mention.

Next Steps: **1.** Actually appearing on _Great Day St. Louis_. **2.** Sleeping with Megan Fox (figure that&#8217;s a given after #1) **3.** World Domination! **4.** Ice cream.
