On Monday the Reliance Bank off of Olive in St. Louis County.  Here&#8217;s a shot of the action:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3007" title="Reliance Bank robber" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Reliance-Bank-robber.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/01/Reliance-Bank-robber.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/01/Reliance-Bank-robber-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]

The cops believe that the suspect is a man in his 50s wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses and a dark jacket.  But thats probably because they have a freaking picture of an older guy in the bank holding a gun wearing a cap, sunglasses and a dark jacket. Nice work. The suspect is either him or the lady in pink, but she doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that in to the money and she&#8217;s not holding a gun.

Frankly at first it seemed shocking that people still even robs banks these days.  I mean don&#8217;t they have a computer?  Isn&#8217;t that where these things happen now?  Well in this guys case maybe just going to the bank to rob it was the move. I hear its hard to rob a bank with Internet Explorer 3 on Windows 95 with so many toolbars installed you can only see a sliver of the internet.

My guess is that this all started because he couldn&#8217;t figure out the ATM.
