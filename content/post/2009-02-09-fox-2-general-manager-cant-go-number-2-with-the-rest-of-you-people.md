[STLMedia.net][1] is saying that Fox 2&#8217;s general manager has not only being pushing the construction union&#8217;s limits by trying to get the workers at the KPLR studios to work through their breaks, but also has spent $60,000 on a private bathroom for his office all while more layoff rumors swirl around the new &#8220;siamese stations.&#8221;

Apparently the troops at 2 and 11 know about the expensive crapper and are less than pleased.
