Don&#8217;t you recognize me?!  It&#8217;s St. Charles man!  Your boy St. Chuck!  &#8230;look, I&#8217;ve got a problem man.  Could I get a few bucks from  you?

No no no no!  Its not like that.  Its just&#8230;man&#8230;times are tough dude and I&#8230;I just need a little cash right now to get me through.

Ok ok.  Its not charity man!  I&#8217;m selling some stuff!   &#8230;um look, <a href="http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/Portals/0/Public%20Works/2009%20Surplus%20Auction.pdf" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a list</a>.  See anything there you like?

I&#8217;ve got a **Palm**!  &#8230;kinda like an iPhone.  You need **eight cardboard magazine holders**?  No?  How about some **well worn, 50 foot microphone cables**?  Oh wait!  A **Zip Drive**!  You wanna a Zip Drive?  Its the eight track of the computer world dude!  You need to store something more than a floppy disk but don&#8217;t want to care around a cumbersome thumb drive with 22x the storage?  Zip drive that crap dude!

&#8230;lets see&#8230;what else do I have&#8230;

A **doorbell** that I&#8217;m not sure works?  Hmmm?  **Office chair, with arms**?  You _love_ arms!

&#8230;ok fine, then how about you give me five bucks and I won&#8217;t stab  you?
