Our tipster clicked St. Louis.

The results weren&#8217;t pretty.

Red is people moving away from St. Louis. Black is people moving too St. Louis.

The red doesn&#8217;t help, it makes it seem like people are leaving a fire trail burning rubber out of here&#8230;which actually would be pretty damn cool, but only until after the fires stopped and you looked around and noticed all that&#8217;s left of the neighborhood is you, the known pedophile and some car-jackingers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If you can see past all the red there is one place people left to actually come <em>to</em> St. Louis. Do you see it?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yeah. It&#8217;s totally Detroit! Freaking losers.

You left St. Louis, whatever. You wanna stay? That&#8217;s cool. &#8230;wait, you are coming here on purpose? &#8230;what hell hole did you leave? Oh Detroit? Makes sense.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Detroit is quickly turning in to one of those cities they use in video games and movies that look so horrible and shitty with amazing crime or horror movie-type plots that people are really surprised when they find out that place actually exists.
