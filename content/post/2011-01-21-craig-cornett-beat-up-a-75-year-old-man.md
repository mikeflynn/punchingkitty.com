Former 93.7 the Bull&#8217;s morning show host **Craig Cornett**&#8216;s fans have been waiting for some time now to find out what Cornett&#8217;s next big project would be. A new job at a local music station? Maybe a straight talk format show? Something online? Nope! The first real mention of Craig Cornett  since dropping of the airwaves in August of 2009 is about&#8230;Cornett beating the hell out of a 75 year old man in the parking lot of a casino!

> Authorities said Cornett, 45, of O&#8217;Fallon, Mo., admitted to assaulting a 75-year-old man who, a St. Charles County deputy said, &#8220;was unable to defend himself due to his age and frailty&#8221; in the parking lot of the Ameristar Casino on Dec. 30, 2010.

Yup, this sounds bad, but lets be fair here. This could be some kind of performance art. Maybe Cornett&#8217;s &#8220;performance&#8221; here is saying that life is futile. Like, sure you think you&#8217;re sitting at age 75 thinking you&#8217;ve dodged life&#8217;s best shots to take you down and all you want to do is go slam nickels in to a slot machine as you wait for natural causes to take their toll when out of nowhere, a former country station morning show host jumps out of his car and beats you like you like a bitch. You know, performance art! &#8230;wacky morning show gag maybe?

> In a court document, authorities said Cornett struck the man in the head and face repeatedly with his fist &#8220;causing the crime victim to fall back into a metal vehicle door. Cornett continually struck the crime victim when no resistance or aggression was presented. The crime victim sustained numerous lacerations, contusions and swelling about his head and face.&#8221;

Nothing says &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/09/02/what-are-you-up-to-craig-cornett/" target="_blank">keeping busy</a>&#8221; like frequenting St. Charles casinos and fighting old men in the parking lot. Be sure to check out Cornett&#8217;s next big projects that include kicking little girls in the neck and telling area vending machines that he &#8220;&#8230;used to be somebody! I used to be on the radio!&#8221;

Cornett is out on bond and will be charged with third-degree assault. A crime that carries a maximum of one year in jail.

This video Cornett made in June of 2009 now seems oddly appropriate:
