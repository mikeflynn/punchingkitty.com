<a rel="attachment wp-att-5858" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/26/rams-and-terrell-owens-getting-desperate-already/terrell-owens/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5858" title="Terrell Owens" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/t_o_.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" /></a>According to ESPN, our, last in the league but first in your hearts, St. Louis Rams are interested in signing general dick-head wide receiver Terrell Owens.

> The Rams asked Owens through his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, if he would consider a serious contract proposal, even though they are not considered a playoff contender. Rosenhaus told the team Owens would definitely consider it, sources said.
> 
> One source said the Rams have gotten very aggressive in their pursuit of Owens and it&#8217;s possible that Owens will sign with the Rams or Bengals within the next 48 to 72 hours.

As a gossip site we can&#8217;t wait for this to happen! T.O. is pure crazy and with the added press on the Rams this year because of 1st overall pick Sam Bradford, something post-worthy will be bound to happen at least weekly. As a football fan though, this doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. Bernie Miklasz agrees:

> Let me get this straight: Spagnuolo, who strives to have a quiet, controversy-free working environment and a unified and unselfish team, is thinking about bringing in a reality TV-show star with a craving for attention?
> 
> It&#8217;s not as if the Rams are a couple of players away from becoming a contender.
> 
> So what would be the point of this? Selling tickets? Maybe. But adding Owens would also create a backlash. The Rams could lose customers because of him.

If the Rams brass are indeed wanting T.O. to play here it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the intelligence of this staff. I makes them seem desperate. Were they told they need to hit a win-mark to keep their jobs next year? I doubt it, but man moves like this makes it seem that way.

This &#8220;desperate&#8221; theme goes for T.O. too&#8230;why on earth would he want to sign with a team going to win a max of 4 games? Unless no one else wants him I don&#8217;t understa&#8230;oh. No one else _does_ want him.

This T.O. / Rams thing is like the two fat kids at school that stopped trying to date the popular kids, just get together, get married and eat cookies in bed forever.
