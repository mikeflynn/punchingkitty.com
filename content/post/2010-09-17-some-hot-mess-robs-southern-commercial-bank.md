Not only do we have photo proof that Tyra Banks was recently in the St. Louis area, but she may have robbed a bank!

Tyra?! Girl you crazy!

> The robbery happened at 2:20 p.m. Wednesday at 3207 Meramec Street. The man walked into the bank and demanded money before fleeing, according to FBI Special Agent Billy Cox.
> 
> The man was described as a black male wearing a purple curly wig, a woman&#8217;s blouse with blue vertical stripes, gray pants and white shoes.
