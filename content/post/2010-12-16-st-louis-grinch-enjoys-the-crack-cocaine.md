[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8231" title="grinch" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/12/grinch.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]As we all know it&#8217;s a rough time out there for everyone, but the economy is hitting the crack heads the hardest. Find out what one Belleville woman sold to get herself a little taste right after the weather!

It&#8217;s cold, rainy and totally sucks.

Cool, one Belleville woman is behind bars tonight after selling her children&#8217;s Christmas gifts to purchase crack.

> Sheriff&#8217;s Capt. Steven Johnson said Bauers, the mother of two young sons, stole about $1,000 worth of toys and gifts that the children&#8217;s grandmother bought last week. [Sandra J. Bauers] then sold the gifts to buy crack, he said.

To be fair, your kids will be your kids for like forever, but crack is a right now, &#8220;I totally need it to kill the bugs crawling under my skin.&#8221; kinda thing.

It gets worse though&#8230;

> [The children&#8217;s grandmother, Pamela Gyon] said her husband is fighting cancer and is on disability. He received his monthly disability check last week and Gyon went shopping for the grandkids. Gyon bought about $1,000 in presents for the children, intending to let Bauers give some of them to her two sons as if she had purchased them.
> 
> On Thursday night, after the shopping spree, Bauers slept over at the grandmother&#8217;s home in the 100 block of Pecan Lane, in unincorporated St. Clair County. They kept the presents in the grandmother&#8217;s vehicle so the kids wouldn&#8217;t see them, Johnson said.
> 
> The next morning, the 4-year-old boy woke up, looking for his mother. Bauers was gone &#8212; and so was the grandmother&#8217;s car full of gifts.

Holy crap. Wait wait wait&#8230;it gets worse&#8230;er&#8230;

> &#8220;Sandra is driving, and in her right hand is a crack pipe,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;She admits she sold all of the presents. She sold some of the stuff to a crack house. She sold some at a pawn shop/liquor store at 15th and Missouri in East St. Louis. She sold some on the street.&#8221;
> 
> The gifts included children&#8217;s toys, figurines, clothing, blankets, DVDs.
> 
> &#8220;We had Nerf machine guns, the big ones. Lots of t-shirts and jeans and socks and underwear. Pillow pets,&#8221; said the grandmother, Gyon.

Nice plug for Pillow Pets, but&#8230;yeah&#8230;there&#8217;s more&#8230;

> The gifts were not only for Bauers&#8217; two children, they were for all of the grandmother&#8217;s five grandchildren and one great-niece.

&#8230;and more&#8230;

> And what kind of Christmas will the grandkids have now?
> 
> &#8220;None,&#8221; the grandmother says flatly. &#8220;We&#8217;re on disability and we don&#8217;t get paid again until January.&#8221;

Anyone else imagining this lady Grinch-style with the way over-stuffed bag of toys staring down a little sad Whovillian?

While sitting in jail late last night, crackhead Sandra J. Bauers thought about all the Christmases she&#8217;d ruined and as she thought about it her heart grew ten times it&#8217;s size that night&#8230;and then she died&#8230;crack abuse can give you <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_heart/symptoms.htm" target="_blank">Cardiomegaly</a>, so she&#8217;s dead. Real human hearts don&#8217;t just grow like that because of love, you dumbass, and secondly how the hell can something <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/12/grinch_heart.jpeg" target="_blank">grow big enough to break the xray scope</a>?! Makes no sense at all. In fact, we&#8217;re starting to think this Dr. Seuss isn&#8217;t really all that much of a doctor after all!

(She&#8217;s not really dead. She&#8217;s still alive and horrible and all about the crack, but that&#8217;s not as funny as sticking to the Grinch theme.)
