What the hell is it about time lapse videos that are so damn entertaining?  I don&#8217;t know either, but I just found a St. Louis themed one on Vimeo:

<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;">
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/8554587" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Walking around, or a sped up day (ahem) are really is the best uses of time lapse.  Porn I think would be really weird all sped up. It would be over so quick, you really couldn&#8217;t enjoy yourself.  Oh wait.  I think I just found some sympathy for women.  Give me a second it will pass&#8230;

There it goes.
