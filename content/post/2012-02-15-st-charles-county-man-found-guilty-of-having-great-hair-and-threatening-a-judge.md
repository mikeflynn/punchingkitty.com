The only thing we can imagine Alex being guilty of is having a fantastic head of hair of black slik spun from the gods themselves, but there&#8217;s some other stuff like threatening a judge and his family. Nothing he couldn&#8217;t have gotten out of with one of those quick look back moves like on Charlie&#8217;s Angels.

> Alexander V. Long, 23, pleaded guilty in October to two federal counts of mailing threatening communications and one count of making an interstate transmission containing a threat and admitted sending threats through Facebook and the mail.
> 
> Long threatened to rape, stab and beat a judge&#8217;s daughter, and threatened the others, including Prosecuting Attorney Jack Banas, prosecutor Gwendolyn Goeke and the girl&#8217;s father, during the investigation of those threats.

Ok that actually sounds pretty bad, but seeing as he&#8217;ll be living in a federal prison for the next couple of years, it&#8217;s great to hear he&#8217;s already comfortable with the subject of rape.
