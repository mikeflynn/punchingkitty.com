According to ESPN&#8217;s MLB prospect, and faking himself into thinking he is way more important than he is expert, Keith Law says St. Louis Cardinals prospect Casey Mulligan might be good enough to get to St. Louis this summer:

> Relievers don&#8217;t usually make my top 100 unless they&#8217;re top-shelf, but ex-catcher Casey Mulligan and his plus changeup could sneak into the big leagues this year.

You might recognize the name Casey Mulligan.  Since he&#8217;s not quite famous for his relief pitching just yet, you probably know him as the ballplayer that suddenly busted out a rendition of Thriller during a rain delay.

We really hope Law is right.  St. Louis has had a real lack of interesting bullpen guys since our favorite Steve Kline left.
