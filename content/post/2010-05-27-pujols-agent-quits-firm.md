Pujols&#8217; agent, Dan Lozano, pulled a Jerry McGuire Tuesday, leaving his prominent sports agency and taking with him his list of big time clients.

Pujols, an eight-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player with the St. Louis Cardinals, is closing in on free agency, and is expected to sign an enormous contract in the aftermath of big recent deals for Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer, Philadelphia first baseman Ryan Howard and others.

Sounds like a good move to us. Why share any more of the agent cut of a contract nearing $300 Million?  &#8230;This could mean Lozano will be pushing Pujols to go big with no discounts for the home team.

Lozano&#8217;s other big name clients include Jimmy Rollins and the Ranger&#8217;s Michael Young, though its not known if they have expressed interests in staying with the now solo Lozano.

What is known is that sometimes I name drop the names of hot chicks that have nothing to do with St. Louis on here as an excuse for posting their picture.
