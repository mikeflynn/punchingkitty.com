If you are a skinny girl, with plenty of attitude, very little brains and don&#8217;t mind being used and told you are going to have an awesome modeling career only to end up in a freaking Chili&#8217;s commercial 2 months later, then you are in luck!  America&#8217;s Next Top Model tryouts are coming to town!

Tomorrow, July 11th, Tyra&#8217;s posse will be looking for girls ages 18-27 that are over 5&#8217;7&#8243;.

If you get there early enough (within the first 150) you will get a taped audition and be in the running for a audition with people you might recognize (or not) later on.

I should also mention that private auditions for Punching Kitty.com&#8217;s Next Top Model are always open and we are looking for cute girls, 18-25 with questionable morals and a love of exotic dance.
