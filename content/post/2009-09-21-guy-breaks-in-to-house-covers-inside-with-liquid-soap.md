Wait, what?

> A man who allegedly broke into a house because it was a place to smoke cocaine and “cool off” then spread liquid hand soap about the house before leaving, St. Louis County police said.
> 
> Darion J. Ellis, 18, of Florissant, told police he poured the liquid soap throughout the house to clean up after himself, according to the police report.

Weird huh?  Don&#8217;t worry the police have it figured out.

> Police believe Ellis selected the house randomly and likely was high when he spread the soap inside the home, spokesman Rick Eckhard said.

&#8220;Likely was high&#8221;?  Solid police work.

Next week we will see a report of a guy shooting his girlfriend, to which the cops will release the following statement:  &#8220;He was likely mad at her about something.&#8221;
