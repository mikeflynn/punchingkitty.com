I was going to start this off with the rhetorical question of &#8220;Does anyone at the Post Dispatch even look at STLToday.com?&#8221;  but I stopped short because I knew I was going to get tons of &#8220;Have you seen the green on their site?  &#8230;I&#8217;m guessing no.&#8221;-type comments.

Look, you can hate on the abortion that was their old navigation, and say their new one looks like it took them 20 seconds to put together, and arguments could be made in their defense (I&#8217;m guessing)&#8230;but the least&#8230;and I mean the least&#8230;they could do is to take off ads for a contest that&#8217;s prize involved spending New Year&#8217;s Eve with a playmate!

It takes 20 seconds.   Seriously.
