Cincinnati Reds&#8217; Second Baseman Brandon Phillips got a little nicked up playing the Cubs recently, but when asked if he would ok for the big Cardinals series Phillips had this to say (<a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/cincinnatireds/entries/2010/08/09/before_we_dissect_the_chris.html" target="_blank">according to daytondailynews.com</a>):

> “I’d play against these guys with one leg. We have to beat these guys. I hate the Cardinals. All they do is bitch and moan about everything, all of them, they’re little bitches, all of ‘em. I really hate the Cardinals. Compared to the Cardinals, I love the Chicago Cubs. Let me make this clear &#8211; I hate the Cardinals.”

Yup. It&#8217;s pretty clear Brandon.

\*Clears throat\*

Who the f*ck are you calling a little bitch? Is this the guy who is such a douche he won&#8217;t even talk to certain reporters because they dared to question his hustle earlier this year?! Jesus christ&#8230;lets get something straight, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/phillbr01.shtml" target="_blank">hitting a career .268 with an .317 OBP</a> doesn&#8217;t make you a star worthy of blowing off reporters and talking this level of trash, it makes you barely average. Don&#8217;t forget dipshit that your career was pretty much over when the Indians gave up on you, trading you to the Reds for a bag of balls and a fungo bat, probably because your an ass-wipe, but also because you were supposed to be good, but managed to piss away your talent in to being a league-average player and an All-Star bitch.

How did you do yesterday? 0-5 with a strikeout. Cool. Just checking.

#### Dude, Scott&#8230;what&#8217;s up with your boy?!

Um Scott Rolen, the apparent leader in the Reds&#8217; clubhouse&#8230;you down with this shit dude? Even if you twist this in to somehow not being a dig at you and the 48 other ex-Cardinals on the Reds roster, then at least its gotta piss you off taking cheap-shots in the media at your buddies right? You gonna take care of this?

Tony LaRussa picked up on this little nuance himself, <a href="http://www.foxsportsmidwest.com/08/09/10/Phillips-comments-surprise-Cardinals-/landing.html?blockID=286860&feedID=3708" target="_blank">pointing that fact out to Fox Sports Midwest&#8217;s B.J. Rains</a> last night after the game:

> Upon hearing the quote, one Cardinals player asked, “Has Tony (La Russa) heard this?”
> 
> The Cardinals manager apparently had, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “I don’t think that will go over well in his own clubhouse. Phillips is ripping his teammates &#8211; Scott Rolen, Miguel Cairo, Russ Springer, Jim Edmonds &#8211; all the ex-Cardinals over there. He isn’t talking about this year. He is talking about the way we’ve always played and those guys are old Cardinals. Tell him he’s ripping his own teammates because they are all old Cardinals.

That&#8217;s cool man. Get the Cardinals jacked up for the game, it might be just what this team needs to get that spark going.

Oh&#8230;and Pujols would like to see you for a moment Brandon.
