What&#8217;s so special about The Fountain on Locust?

> The Fountain on Locust&#8217;s bathroom was picked because of its hand-painted murals, ornate fixtures and designer mirrors.

You can vote online for the final round at <a href="http://www.bestrestroom.com" target="_blank">www.bestrestroom.com</a>, and then go poop in your now obviously lame bathroom.
