They escaped in to the small town with no shoes but wearing their standard-issue prison orange jumpsuit. Obviously, this has the prison and the town on full alert.

> Three inmates, including a convicted murderer, escaped from a northwest Missouri jail by crawling under a fence, leading authorities to lock down the surrounding community&#8217;s school and to go door-to-door warning residents.

&#8220;Quick! Some one stuff a god damned towel under that fence!&#8221;

> &#8220;I don&#8217;t normally lock my doors, but I am now. I&#8217;m sure everybody is.&#8221; said Karen Shepherd, the city clerk.

The escaped inmates are T**imothy Baudour**, 34, who was convicted ofÂ assault, **Nicholas McCleary**, 26, in on a property damage charged followed up by one failed jail escape, and **Carlos Sarmiento**, 57, who was convicted of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, and second-degree bad 80&#8217;s hair, as evident by the photo above where Sarmiento is rocking a pretty criminal &#8220;sidespike&#8221;.

Authorities are worried that if left to his own devices, Sarmiento might progress in to bad 90&#8217;s hair like the &#8220;under-cut&#8221; if he isn&#8217;t captured soon&#8230;or he might beat someone _else_ to death with a claw hammer. Residents are avised to stay indoors, and keep a look out for a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; in the investigation and possible Sarmiento accomplice judging by the obvious hair-style connections:

Police continue the hunt while the small town of 260 lock their doors, leaving their kids have to suffer through indoor recess. Floor hockey can only take you so far.
