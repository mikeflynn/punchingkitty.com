That&#8217;s the big question for the Cardinals and their fans this offseason: What will happen with **Albert Pujols**, arguably major league baseball&#8217;s best player, and who is less than a year from being a free agent and possibly leaving the Cardinals.

Is our fearless editor, the ruggedly handsome and slighty more popular than the WikiLeaks guy, **Mike Flynn** included in the list of notables as **Tim McKernan** and <a href="http://deadspin.com/" target="_blank">Deadspin&#8217;s</a> **Wil Leitch**? Yes. Yes he is.
