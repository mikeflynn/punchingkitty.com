**Todd Akin** got a new endorsement the other day, but don&#8217;t worry about it. She doesn&#8217;t live in this state, and she&#8217;s just some reality TV show broad that can&#8217;t keep her legs closed.

> **Michelle Duggar** plans to participate in a women-for-Akin event Tuesday in Springfield. The Duggar family is supposed to attend rallies with Akin later that day in Osage Beach and on Wednesday in Farmington and Poplar Bluff.

We don&#8217;t care about your current thoughts on the senate race (But seriously, Akin is a crazy and creepy guy. It&#8217;s not politics, just science.)&#8230;but if the fact that Michelle Dugger, from the reality show &#8220;19 Kids and Counting&#8221;, who clearly has kids for no other reason than to sustain her niche popularity, in any way sways your opinion of who you want to choose for senator, should move to some retard state filled with other dipshits like yourself, where someone like her or Todd Akin, being completely detached form reality, can run for office and have a legitimate chance&#8230;freaking hell, that&#8217;s Missouri. New punishment: You should help us move. Carry our couch, and we&#8217;re going to go buy a big ass marble coffee table before we pack up, so bring gloves! No lunch provided.
