No not that one, the other one. No, the more brutal one. &#8230;ok, it was the one where a man, Zachary Irvin, was dismembered and burned to death. According to <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_ac47182b-0b8b-5ec1-a38c-12729e4b85ee.html" target="_blank">STLToday</a>:

> Irvin&#8217;s dismembered body was found burning on top of a metal landscaping cart nearby. Evidence led investigators to the large warehouse along Front Street, where they found three rooms with blood-spattered floors and walls.
> 
> Police found a meat cleaver, hacksaw, drywall saw, metal shears, claw hammer, rope, tin snips and binding material strewn about the rooms. Most of the items had remnants of a &#8220;red, blood-like substance,&#8221; according to the warrants. Also in the room police found a blood stained bandage.

Two men have been charged with the slaying: James Pierson and Dennis Iagulli, both were homeless until settling in to St. Clair County jail after being arrested when they were found to be in possession of Irwin&#8217;s personal items.

Apparently these days the internet is truly everywhere because, despite being homeless, Dennis Iagulli has a MySpace page. We were tipped off to the page recently and after only a quick look we found numerous items of interest:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5799" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/23/suspect-in-brutal-murder-believes-in-karma-according-to-myspace/dennis_iagulli/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5799" title="dennis_iagulli" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/dennis_iagulli.jpg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" /></a>&#8211; His current mode is &#8220;calm&#8221; &#8230;with a sunglasses smiley face.

&#8211; He goes by &#8220;DJ&#8221;

&#8211; Describes himself as (emphasis ours)  &#8220;Phillipine and Italian 5&#8217;11&#8221; 150lbs. slim masc GAY male who **wholy believes in and Lives by karma**&#8221;  Iagulli finishes up his About Me section with the amazingly creepy: &#8220;I have a plan that will hit the history books hard.(Theres[sic] more coming)&#8221;

&#8211; Interests: &#8220;My Interests vary and are very multiple, you get to know me, you get to know my interests.&#8221; Also creepy considering the circumstances no?

&#8211; Heroes: &#8220;All those people past, present, future who dared to think outside the box and act on what they thought.&#8221; &#8230;some times we shouldn&#8217;t act on every impulse we have though DJ.

&#8211; He&#8217;s gay.

&#8211; Children: &#8220;Love kids, but not for me.&#8221;

&#8211; He smokes and drinks.

&#8211; He claims to have a graduate degree, be self-employed and make &#8220;$250,000 and Higher&#8221; &#8230;I guess &#8220;homeless, alleged psycho&#8221; weren&#8217;t options?

&#8211; Only 5 friends. Tom isn&#8217;t to be found&#8230;anyone seen him lately? Just checking.

&#8211; DJ named his cat &#8220;Mom&#8221;. Freud would love to take a whack at this guy!

Dennis Iagulli&#8217;s live MySpace page is at: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djiagulli" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/djiagulli</a>

Lastly, thanks to our tipster for risking their eyes and mental health by going through MySpace to make this find!
