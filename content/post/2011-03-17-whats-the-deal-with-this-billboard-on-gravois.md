  City dwellers that travel down Gravois, or Hodak&#8217;s fried chicken addicts should recognize this flashy billboard, which has totally become our favorite billboard ever in recent days, but we gotta ask: Anyone know the deal with this thing?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Current theories include a new store selling levitation pants, a hip new funeral home, or simply a cartoon character that took a wrong turn at Albuquerque and laid down for a quick nap. Oh we know its probably some art piece, but a little part of us is hoping he&#8217;s just chillin&#8217; until that sexy face down lady gets some billboard space right above him.
