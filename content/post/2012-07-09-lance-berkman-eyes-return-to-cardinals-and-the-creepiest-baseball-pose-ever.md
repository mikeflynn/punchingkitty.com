Everyone&#8217;s favorite Cardinal not named David Freese, Lance Berkman, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8124389/lance-berkman-st-louis-cardinals-plans-return-soon-break" target="_blank">is about to return to the club</a> after a long stint on the disabled list, and he&#8217;s really looking forward to it. Like super excited. Really really really excited. Creepy excited:

&#8230;maybe a little too excited.

Take it down a notch Lance.
