So remember when we celebrated <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/11/18/happy-jc-corcoran-says-pujols-will-resign-today-day/" target="_blank">&#8220;JC Corcoran Says Pujols Will Re-Sign Today&#8221; Day</a>? Well that whole thing is still going on. No, not the actual day, that came and went with no Pujols news. What&#8217;s still been happening is all the chatter since then which came to a head yesterday after KTRS suspended Corcoran for two weeks, as was <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB0QqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcolumns%2Fdeb-peterson%2Fjc-corcoran-off-the-air-at-ktrs-after-a-spate%2Farticle_668a6f50-1ac5-11e1-9129-001a4bcf6878.html&ei=-LLWTuWyHsmK2QWyk-WRAQ&usg=AFQjCNEENgxgoAPrUbJEXKbuQ0k2okiVdg" target="_blank">initially reported by STLToday</a>, but was independently confirmed with our sources as well. The official word from KTRS has been a firm &#8220;No comment.&#8221;

Lets review how we got here, and we probably don&#8217;t have to tell you that it wasn&#8217;t a failed Pujols report that turned Corcoran&#8217;s mic off. It was probably this stuff:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11189" title="jc_tweet_example" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/jc_tweet_example.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="82" />][1]

You can&#8217;t say that to people! What if &#8220;HueJashole&#8221; is actually 60 years older than he probably is and owns a radio other than the one in his car?! He could be a possible purchaser for whatever it is that advertises on KTRS now that the Cardinals are gone! &#8230;seriously, what is it? Polident and collectable plates with Norman Rockwell paintings on them is all we can think of.

More specifically, according to our source, the last straw was <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2011/11/jc_corcoran_twitter_pujols.php" target="_blank">Chad Garrison&#8217;s Riverfront Times post</a> that listed several of Corcoran&#8217;s more choice Twitter replies, which explains Corcoran&#8217;s extra little venom-dripping tweets mentioning the RFT&#8217;s &#8220;idiot logic&#8221;.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11190" title="jc_tweet_rft" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/jc_tweet_rft.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="93" />][2]

Well that&#8217;s a good point actually. While there is certain validity to the argument that Corcoran is a public figure on a medium based on specific advertiser deals (read: not generic Google ads) and as such he should be keeping his, we&#8217;ll just say it, horribly lame insults to himself&#8230;but on the other hand, if someone&#8217;s being a douche, we&#8217;re certainly not going to get on your case for calling them out. Lets investigate by doing exactly what Corcoran suggests: Showing the whole conversation instead of just Corcoran&#8217;s reply.

**Conversation #1:**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11186" title="jc_tweet_convo_1" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/jc_tweet_convo_1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="359" />][3]

First conversation out of the gate and it&#8217;s if anyone&#8217;s the douchebag in this conversation, it&#8217;s JC. First off, JC&#8217;s original tweet that starts this off is wrong. Dead wrong, and there&#8217;s no other way to see it. The source wasn&#8217;t &#8220;correct&#8221; since there was no deal announced on that fateful Friday. It seems more and more likely that Pujols will return, but Corcoran&#8217;s claim was that Pujols&#8217; re-signing would be announced on Friday, and it wasn&#8217;t. tkooner makes a snide, but harmless remark and somehow that earns a &#8220;blow yourself&#8221;?

Corcoran falls behind early in the match!

_Douche Tally: &#8220;Everyone&#8221;  &#8211; 0, &#8220;JC Corcoran&#8221;: 1_

**Conversation #2:**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11187" title="jc_tweet_convo_2" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/jc_tweet_convo_2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="295" />][4]

&nbsp;

&#8230;but it appears the score might be tied soon as Cardsfan47 comes out of the gate a little strong. We agree that Corcoran threw some shit at the wall and was probably a little surprised by getting burned by the MLB Hot Stove, but jesus dude it&#8217;s not like he took a shit on your dog. Anyway, Cardsfan47 starts off with a &#8220;fucking #moron&#8221; (nice selective use of hash tags) and then JC returns volley with his standard retort&#8230;but here&#8217;s where things get interesting. Cardsfan47 turns JC&#8217;s &#8220;blow yourself&#8221; command on it&#8217;s head by asking Corcoran to do the deed if in fact he is wrong, which is kinda funny&#8230;but then undermines it all with a homophobic joke with added homophobic hashtag because that&#8217;s the kind of thing you really want to be easily searched for later on.

Deuce!

_Douche Tally: &#8220;Everyone&#8221;  &#8211; 1, &#8220;JC Corcoran&#8221;: 1_

**Conversation #3:**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11188" title="jc_tweet_convo_3" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/jc_tweet_convo_3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" />][5]

Lastly, we have conversation #3 where stlcards314 is doing what lots of people do and arguably what Twitter was made for: bitching about stuff he doesn&#8217;t agree with. Once again, Corcoran, no matter what happens tomorrow, the next day or any other time, was wrong in his initial attention grab of a tweet and while he certainly got the attention he knew it would get, having people call you stupid is the price. Seems pretty fair. Corcoran must have pressed the &#8220;Dick Move on Twitter Easy Button&#8221; as here we go again with the douche-calling and the self-blowing so we&#8217;re going to have to give Corcoran another point&#8230;but wait! stlcards314 evens the score with the most out of left field insults to date: &#8220;How&#8217;s the ass raping gang bang of your mother going?&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s one direction we guess, but an ironic &#8220;yo mama&#8221; joke may have been a better play&#8230;actually lots of stuff would have been a better play. Frankly this is just sad all around as both of these guys let someone they don&#8217;t know over Twitter get under their skin over when some latino guys going to come back to town.

_Douche Tally: &#8220;Everyone&#8221;  &#8211; 2, &#8220;JC Corcoran&#8221;: 2_

In the end the score was technically tied, but Corcoran is clearly the loser. While it&#8217;s a free country stlcards314, cardsfan47, tkooner and yes, even punchingkitty can make fun of stljccorcoran all we want on Twitter because we aren&#8217;t being paid by advertisers, sure he&#8217;s getting some press (lead story on &#8220;some local news channel&#8221;!) it won&#8217;t translate to much of anything in the long run. Frankly the &#8220;media&#8221; just isn&#8217;t as untouchable as they have been in the past (see <a href="http://www.kfns.com/JoeSportsFan/Story.aspx?ID=1578636" target="_blank">Matt Sebek&#8217;s excellent article</a> for more thoughts on this) and guys like JC have gotten really used to being &#8220;A guy on the radio!!!!&#8221;, but haven&#8217;t noticed they are now they are just &#8220;A guy on the radio.&#8221; It&#8217;s just not special any more&#8230;hell, head on down to KFNS where Crazy Dave Greene is running a sale on air time! Just ask and agree to work for free and you too can be &#8220;A guy on the radio.&#8221;

So what does all this mean for the mid-day shift at the Big 550? Our source says Smash will be taking over the time slot keeping the seat warm for Corcoran, but we&#8217;re not sure if that includes any extra-circular self-fellatio advice dispensing. It&#8217;s still unclear at this time if Smash will be alone or if Corcoran&#8217;s side kick, St. Louis radio mainstay, Trish Gazall will be on the air during Corcoran&#8217;s absence.

From JC and the Punching Kitty family to yours, go blow yourself you douche bag and happy holidays!
