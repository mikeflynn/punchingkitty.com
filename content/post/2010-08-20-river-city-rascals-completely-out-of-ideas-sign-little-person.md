In an effort to reenact Bill Veeck&#8217;s famous &#8220;sign a midget since no one can strike him out&#8221; move last night, the O&#8217;Fallon, Misouri independent league baseball team, signed a short(est) stop of their own. Welcome Eddie Gaedel 2010 aka Nick Hagan!

According to Nick&#8217;s bio <a href="http://www.rivercityrascals.com/team/playerscoaches/index.html?player_id=63" target="_blank">on the Rascals site</a>, he is listed as &#8220;utility&#8221; under position. Born in 1994, the 4&#8217;0&#8243;, 110 lbs Hagan is described as an &#8220;avid gamer&#8221; and has a yellow belt in Karate. Neither of which are in any way important facts or interesting in the least.

In other, slightly more important news, in line at Starbucks, a pretty girl thought I was trying to sniff her hair and called me a creepy perv. What an idiot! Doesn&#8217;t she know how close you have to get to land a clear upskirt shot from my shoe-camera?
