Watch out folks. Gonna be hotter than hell on Monday.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4640" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/21/you-know-those-st-louis-summers/ljumv/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4640" title="ljumV" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ljumV.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="535" height="403" /></a>Kinda hope this is true. We&#8217;d get some odd satisfaction of watching each station&#8217;s weather person go crazy over the now destroyed all time high temperature record in May&#8230;and right before they pitch it back to sports, they burst in to flames.
