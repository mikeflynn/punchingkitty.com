> ST. LOUIS (AP) — A homeless man is expecting recover after passing out in a tank that continued residue of a hazardous chemical.
> 
> [The Tank] had residue from a chemical called Toluene, which is used in paint and paint thinners.

St. Louis&#8217; plan to capture and do awesome experiments on the homeless was thwarted by the employees of Brenntag Co, who saw the man and called the authorities.  If it wasn&#8217;t for that meddling St. Louis&#8217; scientists could have created superhuman homeless guys by now!

When the city was asked why there was a &#8220;Free food!  Don&#8217;t mind the smell&#8230;&#8221; sign in front of the tank, they replied &#8220;How &#8217;bout that National Health Care plan?!&#8221;  and then ran out of the room during the ensuing argument.

Also,

> The name of the man, in his 50s, was not released.

His name wasn&#8217;t released because frankly no one cares.  I mean if they released the name would you be all like &#8220;Oh yeah Earl!  Good guy&#8230;needs to get a home.&#8221;?  No.  Hell even if you did know him what would that do?  I&#8217;m not sure why they ever release anyone&#8217;s name for news stories like this.
