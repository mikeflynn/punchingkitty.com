<a rel="attachment wp-att-4282" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/03/really-ksdks-art-holliday-has-a-fan-club/art_and_jennifer_ksdk/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4282" title="art_and_jennifer_ksdk" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/art_and_jennifer_ksdk.jpg?filter=polaroid&w=250" alt="" /></a>Last night we ran across the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=50482626950" target="_blank">Art Holliday Fan Club on Facebook</a>.

Seriously.

It gets better though. It&#8217;s 350 members actually aren&#8217;t just there for the irony. They make use of the discussion board with topics like &#8220;Art&#8217;s Many Looks&#8221; where Patricia Cashman writes:

> He has got tons of class. He always looks like he is straight out of GQ, but honestly, when he wears his suspenders without his jacket on&#8230;I just think he makes all the other men in the news business look like wimpy. Jennifer always says that he is the &#8220;best dressed male anchor&#8221;. I think he is perfectly, flawlessly groomed in ANY group of men. I&#8217;ve never seen him in his tennis clothes, but I wish someone would post a picture!!

How can this get any better? &#8230;what if the actual Art Holliday fully participated in his own fan club and dropped in non-sensical one-liners?

> I never disagree with a woman holding a gun.
> 
> Art Holliday

That, from the man himself, was the next post in the discussion. Also, we love it when people don&#8217;t at all get the internet or facebook and &#8220;sign&#8221; their comments as though we don&#8217;t see the author&#8217;s name at the beginning of the comment.

KSDK mornings partner chimes in as well. Jennifer Blome drops this note:

> OKAY fans, did you ever wonder what Art does during the commercials?
  
> Little know fact&#8230;During the McDonald&#8217;s commercial, he sings along.
  
> Imagine if you will&#8230;&#8221;Give me back that fillet of fish. Give me back that fish&#8221;
  
> Wish you all could be here!!!

&#8230;to which Art replies&#8230;

> That crazy song is on a loop in my head. I&#8217;ll never look at a fish sandwich the same again.
> 
> Art

&#8230;and then some other person says&#8230;

> HAHA! That story just made my evening! Thanks Jennifer!!

What?! How could that have possibly made your evening?! How horrible of an evening could you have been having that a story about Art Holliday singing to a commercial &#8220;made&#8221; it for you?! Were you being viciously raped by an escaped lion? Did you contract a flesh-eating virus? Did the naked Puerto Rican you keep in your basement escape? How could that have in any way made your evening! Impossible.

Is this for real? I know this post has no structure, no meat to it, and we&#8217;re very sorry, but we are just in awe of the awesome weirdness of Art Holliday&#8217;s Facebook Fan Club&#8230;that he himself joined&#8230;and so did Jennifer Blome.

What the f*ck is going on here?!
