(Ah! We see what you did there with your name being &#8220;Pokin&#8221; and all. Clever)  <a href="http://suburbanjournals.stltoday.com/articles/2010/10/22/stcharles/news/1020stc-pokin0.txt" target="_blank">Dude straight said St. Charles County has better teeth than those on the right side of the Missouri River.</a>

Oh wait. First he calls us bullies!

> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being oversensitive when I say a lot of people in St. Louis like to make fun of us. They&#8217;ll make snooty comments about our love of hunting, guns and squirrel recipes.

> And lately, some have portrayed us as a backwards, bike-a-phobic people.

Woah! Ok there Mr. Accusations. We don&#8217;t remember doing anything like that.

> A bill is working its way through St. Charles County’s political system that would ban bicycles traffic on streets such as Highway D, DD, F, Z, and 94. Maybe the move here would be to spend some time renaming these dumb-ass highways…except for Highway Double-D, that one can stay. Boobs.

> &#8230;this is St. Charles County we are talking about. The home of “Christian” values, sweater vests and happiness for all…unless you are gay, mexican or hold any opinion other than the norm. Is that a generalization? Of course. But you gotta admit its damn close to spot on.

[Fade back in&#8230;]

Oh _that_ St. Charles County. Ok, we may have fired some shots. Fair enough.

Pokin continues&#8230;

> A story in the current issue of Men&#8217;s Health magazine. Men&#8217;s Health researched by U.S. city how healthy our teeth are and concluded St. Louis has the worst teeth in the nation. The good citizens of San Jose, Calif., have the best.

First off Mr. Pokin, these don&#8217;t count as &#8220;bad teeth&#8221;:

They are expensive, shiny and because of the last two things we said, awesome. Also worth noting is that the most egregious of your county&#8217;s dental delinquents are usually rocking camouflage, making them all but invisible to the naked eye. and thus uncountable in your scientific study.

Also, if we were you, we certainly wouldn&#8217;t pull the &#8220;we don&#8217;t like to look at you at Cardinal games&#8221; card. Ahem&#8230;
