Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House and who&#8217;s current hobbies include pretending to still be involved in presidential candidate races was in St. Louis last weekend and, as reported on Twitter yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/kimj721/status/192098334666801154" target="_blank">via several animal-based puns</a>, was nipped by a penguin while visiting the St. Louis Zoo.

> During his visit to the popular zoo in Forest Park, he was treated to a behind-the-scenes visit with two Magellanic penguins. One of them nipped Gingrich on the finger.
> 
> Zoo spokeswoman Susan Gallagher says a small bandage was all the medical care required.

&#8220;Well that&#8217;s the last time you&#8217;re going to stick your finger in there!&#8221; is probably what the zookeeper said and also what Gingrich&#8217;s ex-wife told him right before he decided to dump her because she wasn&#8217;t pretty and had cancer. &#8220;Vagina cancer probably!&#8221; is what Newt most likely said to someone during a high-five.
