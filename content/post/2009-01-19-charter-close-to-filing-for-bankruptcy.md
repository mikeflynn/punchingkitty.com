2009 is going to be the best!  I, like most of St. Louis, hate Charter with a passion.  Well, let me re-phrase.  I don&#8217;t _hate_ them, its just that they treat their customers like shit, and I know they&#8217;ve done a little bit to help that recently, but the damage has been done and its too little too late.  I would love to like them, but it just doesn&#8217;t look like its going to happen&#8230;especially since they are this close to filing for bankruptcy!

The big wigs at Charter were due to pay $73.7 million dollars the other day for interest on some of their debt and they just didn&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m sure when they got called by the debtors itwent something like this:

> Debtor: &#8220;Hey, we didn&#8217;t get the $73.7 million dollars you owe us.&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;What?!  Hmmm&#8230;we sent one of our service experts over to your office as we told you we would between 12 pm and 5 pm yesterday.  Were you not there?&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;Um&#8230;yeah, we were here all day waiting for you.&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;It says here we tried to call you.&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;No.  No one called.&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t know what to tell you&#8230;our records say that we contacted you and you did not respond. You didn&#8217;t leave at all?&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;Well, I stepped outside for a smoke at one point, but someone should have been up there.&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;Yeah, thats when we stopped by.  You missed us.&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even tell you what time I stepped out!&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for  your inconvenience.   Would you like to make another appointment?&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;Well, I really need that $73.7 million dollars, so yeah!&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;I have an opening in 2 weeks from Wednesday.&#8221;
>
> Debtor: &#8220;What?!  2 weeks!  Thats insane!&#8221;
>
> Charter: &#8220;Well, please be in your office, by your phone next time.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?&#8221;

We know how you feel&#8230;good luck Debtor!
