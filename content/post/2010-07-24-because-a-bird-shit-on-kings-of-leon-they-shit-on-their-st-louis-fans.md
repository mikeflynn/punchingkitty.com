**Now with press release update! (see below)**

_We always thought their music was shitty&#8230;_

Three songs in to their show at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater Friday night, **Kings of Leon** left the stage and their manager came out to announce that the show was over. It was being cancelled due to a safety issue &#8220;beyond their control&#8221; and there was no choice in the matter.

As the crowd chanted &#8220;Bullshit! Bullshit!&#8221; you&#8217;ve got to wonder, what could have caused a band to be in such harm that they cancelled the show so abruptly, leaving tons of fans pissed off? People were definitely pissed, as we should Friday night, but the cause was still up in the air at that point.

The answer? Bird shit.

Freaking bird shit.

A bird shit on their bassist. Apparently a little got in his mouth and this was viewed as a &#8220;safety concern&#8221; out of the band&#8217;s control.

Our initial thought was that once again will St. Louis be featured in the low-point on a band&#8217;s Behind the Music, but if Kings of Leon gets a Behind the Music and someone way more talented than them, like Banarama, doesn&#8217;t get one we&#8217;ll be pissed.

From the Kings of Leon drummer, Nathan Followill, via his Twitter account &#8220;**<a href="http://twitter.com/doctorfollowill" target="_blank">doctorfollowill</a><span style="font-weight: normal;">&#8220;</span>** who&#8217;s tweets are protected from public viewing:

> So sorry St. Louis. We had to bail, pigeons shitting in jareds mouth. Too unsanitary to continue.
> 
> Don’t take it out on Jared, it’s the fucking venues fault. You may enjoy being shit on but we don’t. Sorry for all who traveled many miles.

Jesus these guys are freaking retarded. You too big of a star to just move your little corporate-emo bitch ass 2 feet to the left? Also, you&#8217;re a bassist&#8230;close your mouth. Is it really the venue&#8217;s fault, the open-air venue&#8217;s fault, that a bird pooped on you? Yell &#8220;Dude!&#8221;, spit, get a drink of water and keep going you douche bags! &#8220;You may enjoy being shit on but we don&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8230; apparently _Queens_ of Leon do enjoy all over their fans though if this is the best they could do. Congratulations, you just outted yourself to even your most die-hard fans that you are no more &#8220;rock&#8221; than Hanna Montana.

What about those that paid good money to see these vaginas with guitars? Live Nation, the show&#8217;s promoter, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as of this writing, still had no information on their site about any possible refunds for those that had the honor of witnessing Pussy Rockerfest 2010</span> **Update**: In <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/24/translating-kings-of-leons-poopstock-memo/" target="_blank">a press release</a> the band&#8217;s management stated that Live Nation would be issuing full refunds to any ticket holder.

Oh and one last note to the band: If you ever, somehow, play in St. Louis again. Rest assured any shit falling on you that time won&#8217;t be from a bird.

**Update!** Just after pressing &#8220;Publish&#8221; Kings of Leon released a statement on &#8220;Poopstock&#8221;. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/24/translating-kings-of-leons-poopstock-memo/" target="_blank">Go here to see our translation.</a>
