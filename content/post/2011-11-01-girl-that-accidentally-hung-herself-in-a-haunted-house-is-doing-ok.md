After a stint in the ICU, she has been moved after her condition improved.

> The girl was working as an actress to scare guests when she was hurt on Thursday evening. A co-worker who makes rounds to check the safety of employees found her in the noose. She was unconscious.
> 
> Authorities have said it appears to have been an accident.

First off, duh. She&#8217;s being paid to scare people&#8230;there&#8217;s a noose right there&#8230;insert head A in to loop B to scare hoosier C. She just forgot the &#8220;D, don&#8217;t actually hang yourself.&#8221;

Oh, and kids, if you are thinking about taking a after school job and you find out that there is a person at your job who&#8217;s role is to walk around and check on the &#8220;safety of [the] employees&#8221;, don&#8217;t take that job&#8230;unless that guy is a bouncer and you&#8217;re a hot girl with daddy issues. Otherwise just go get a safe job. For example, if you work at Taco Bell no one&#8217;s going to worry about you not come home after your shift. Just don&#8217;t get any of that &#8220;meat&#8221; in your mouth&#8230;actually we&#8217;d avoid any skin contact at all just to be safe.
