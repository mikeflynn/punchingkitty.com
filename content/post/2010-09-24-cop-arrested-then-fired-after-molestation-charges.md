It&#8217;s not looking good for Peterson either since his own department found enough evidence to prompt an arrest and nearly immediate firing.

> Thursday [Dan Peterson] was released from jail until prosecutors review the case.  Peterson&#8217;s former chief tells News 4&#8217;s Maggie Crane why he fired him.
> 
> Berkeley police say one of their own crossed the line.
> 
> &#8220;We&#8217;re held to a higher standard as law enforcement or even public safety,&#8221; Berkeley Police Chief Col. Frank McCall Jr. says.

&#8220;Higher standard&#8221;? I think molesting kids is generally believed to be below the bar for anyone, no matter their career path. &#8230;Well, except for those pervs over at the DMV right Chief McCall?!

> Chief McCall fired rookie officer Phillip Daniel Peterson.

We know. Good mid-story review though!

> A Ferguson mother says Peterson sexually abused her 15-year-old daughter.
> 
> &#8220;I can&#8217;t go into specifics, but I will say that there was enough documentation and enough information uncovered that warranted the decision that we made,&#8221; McCall says.

Well done Berkley&#8217;s finest! Bringing the creeps down even if they work with them. Commendable to say the least.

> But what was uncovered internally cannot be used against him criminally.

Son of a bitch! Are you serious?

> The victim&#8217;s mother claims 27-year-old Peterson sent several inappropriate text messages and emails to her daughter.

The best thing to do when trying to have an illicit relationship is to leave notes that are saved forever on the one thing that 15-year old girls leave laying around and her parents pay for.

> She says the two met at Risen Lord Community Church in St. Charles.

Keeps getting better.

> While Peterson was involved with the youth group, a pastor there tells News 4 via email that Peterson was never employed by the church.

&#8220;No we never &#8216;hired&#8217; him. We just let any dude we see with a van and binoculars in the church parking lot. Have you met our children&#8217;s massage specialist Lester?&#8221;
