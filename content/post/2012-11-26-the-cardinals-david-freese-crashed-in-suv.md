<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/david-freese/" target="_blank"><strong>David Freese</strong></a> can drive a baseball, but driving cars can still be a challenge. The Cardinals third basemen crashed his car Thursday while trying to avoid a deer. It&#8217;s his third accident over the last few years, but this crash didn&#8217;t involved alcohol and luckily Freese was unharmed.

> Freese, 29, was heading south on Wildhorse Creek Road near Rieger Road in Wildwood when he crashed his 2011 black Range Rover into a tree to avoid a deer, said St. Louis County Police Officer Randy Vaughn. The crash occurred at 2:30 p.m.
> 
> Freese did not hit the deer, Vaughn said. Freese was already out of his SUV when police arrived for what was originally called in as “automobile accident with injury.” After two police cars arrived, an ambulance was not called to the scene. While talking at length with officers Freese refused medical treatment when offered, Vaughn said. The SUV was towed from the crash scene.
> 
> Investigators say alcohol was not a factor in the crash and “no other investigations are under way.”

While is wasn&#8217;t stated in the accident record, word is the deer was wearing a San Francisco Giants jersey and attempted to throw Freese a soft curve ball when the Cardinal got all frantic, tried to do too much, lost control of an easily winnable situation and crashed. Right after the crash Joe Buck even drove by, rolled down his window and did five minutes on how lovable, awesome, and not at all douchy former Giants closer Brian Wilson is. Freese should expect a call from Tim McCarver any day now explaining to him what he did wrong there and how it would have been different in the 60s followed by an unrelated Bob Gibson story.
