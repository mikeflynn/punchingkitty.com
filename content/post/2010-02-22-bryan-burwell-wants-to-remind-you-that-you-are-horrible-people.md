Bryan Burwell wants you to leave professional athletes alone!  Why?  Because you &#8220;fans&#8221; are all horrible people! &#8230;I mean not all of you, but enough that he feels its ok to blame us all for the bad ones.

> I have to laugh when I listen to or read the voice of the outraged fan who now believes that he is entitled to more out of Woods than he has already given. Entitlement doesn&#8217;t look good on anyone, and the truth is, too many fans are just as guilty nowadays as the players they often scold for the same behavior.

> They scream at the players, they scream at the manager. From behind the chain-link fences that ring the practice fields, they jockey for position with all the decorum of a rugby scrum.

So we should give a pass to athletes that are horrible people just because other people are horrible too?  That&#8217;s akin to saying &#8220;Well yeah the guy murdered 15 infants, but he&#8217;s not the first!  &#8230;get out of here you little scamp!  Are you free to babysit this weekend?&#8221;

We wanted more on this issue, so we prodded Burwell and in turn he sent us this video clip to further his case:



We&#8217;re not sure that helped.
