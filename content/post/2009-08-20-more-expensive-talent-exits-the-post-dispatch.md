[We told you][1]!  We knew Pam Maples wouldn&#8217;t be the last high-priced head in the basket below the Post Dispatch&#8217;s guillotine. Yesterday news broke that the deputy managing editor, **Christy Bertelson** is retiring.  Yup, retiring.  Read in to that what you may&#8230;

Bertelson has worked at the Post for 23 years, working her way up from reporter to her current post, and helping lead the PD through their best times.

You can read her resignation letter over at [the Daily RFT][2].
