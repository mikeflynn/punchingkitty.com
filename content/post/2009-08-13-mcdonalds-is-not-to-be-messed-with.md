I would try to explain this, but its best I don&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ll let the email he sent to McDonalds do the explaining:

> I went through drive-thru and ordered one double-quarter pounder meal. When I got to the drive thru window I was asked to move forward. Having problems with McDonald&#8217;s in the past taking a long time to make food if I pulled forward I told them no, I did not want to move forward, I will wait here for my hamburger and fries. They continued to knock on my window for about a minute until a manager, Marie, walked out of the McDonald&#8217;s, approached the car and knocked on my window. I told her I would like to just wait for my food here and to please go make it so I could leave. She knocked several more times before she went inside. Another McDonald&#8217;s employee came outside and directed cars in drive-thru to leave McDonald&#8217;s and exit the parking lot. After waiting several minutes I rolled down my window and asked if the food was done. My reply was the middle finger from one of the employees and comments of &#8220;he must be crazy&#8221;. They then locked the drive-thru window. After waiting ten minutes I knocked on the drive-thru window and asked for the food or money back. No response. I pulled out of drive-thru, parked my car and entered McDonalds. I patiently waited at the front counter. After 2 minutes the manager addressed me, saying they would not serve the food or provide a refund and to talk to the police outside. I went outside and spoke with the police and told them what I have written here. The manager came out too. The police told the manager to go get my food. The manager did so and the police said I could leave.

We will admit that we aren&#8217;t a fan of the &#8220;pull forward so we can take forever with your meal&#8221; play many fast food joints employ, but we can also say that we never thought to just sit there&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and then try to return our food</span>.

We want to give out a hardy &#8220;Good for you!  Stick it to the man!&#8221; but frankly you both sides are crazy in this battle.  [_Editor&#8217;s Note: That&#8217;s a [common theme][2] these days in St. Louis._]

Oh wait!  There&#8217;s video!
