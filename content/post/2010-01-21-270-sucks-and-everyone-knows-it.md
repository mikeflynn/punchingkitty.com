270 ranked 45th in the nation&#8217;s worst commutes according to The Daily Beast.  Totaling 89 hours of congestion, and 1.26 miles long at its worst, earned 270 the spot.

On a comment attached to our snippet, they have a quote via the Post Dispatch from Maryland Heights Councilwoman Mary Nichols:

> Replacement of the current design with the diverging diamond interchange will not only improve the flow of traffic along the 270-70 corridor, but it will also be a national example of innovation in highway safety and design.

&#8220;&#8230;but&#8230;&#8221; Nichols followed, &#8220;to do that, we&#8217;ll have to close the whole thing down for 2 years and then when its done it really won&#8217;t be much better, but it will look like it should be.&#8221;
