Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill was the guest on Comedy Central&#8217;s Colbert Report recently and she spent her time rocking the standard Sentate-issued string of pearls while spouting verbal pearls like

> You know what I got for Missouri? &#8230;I hope? Affordable, accessible insurance for everyone who wants it.

Very safe Senator.  Well played.  You forgot &#8220;Go America!&#8221; and &#8220;What are you hoosier complaining about? Now you can shoot yourself and get fixed up on the house!&#8221; but other than that, nicely done.

Other than that she played along with Colbert&#8217;s schtick&#8230;well you know what? We can&#8217;t tell if she&#8217;s playing along or not actually, but she did finally get Colbert to stop calling our state &#8220;Missou-rah&#8221; so it all evens out. &#8230;or should we say, sliding to the middle.

Well played indeed Senator.

As a congratulatory note, Punching Kitty has paid for a coffin full of flowers and candy to be delivered to the Senator&#8217;s home later today.  Now that we think about it, we hope doesn&#8217;t get the wrong idea about our gift.  We were going to call her ahead of time and say &#8220;Break a leg!&#8221; but we were worried about her taking us too seriously and then reaching in to our pockets for money so she could get herself fixed up.

See the whole interview after the jump!
