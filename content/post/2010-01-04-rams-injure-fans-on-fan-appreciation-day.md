Two &#8220;fans&#8221; fell out of the stands on Sunday while reaching for shoes that were tossed in to the stands by Rams players.

One left strapped to a gurney, but apparently Coach Spags seemed to think both fans were not seriously hurt at the press conference.  You know because they just use gurneys for things like scraped knees and boo-boos.

Hmmm.  This might explain a lot with the Rams injury situation this year.
