Oh yeah&#8230;they lost the game vs the 49ers though.  Totally got killed.

But now we have the #1 pick in the next draft, which is huge, because we really haven&#8217;t done all that well with the #2 pick.  Chris Long?  Eh.  We&#8217;ll see.  Jason Smith?  Ditto, though he was screwed up by the Rams bizarre choice to not play him right away and when they did, play him at a foreign position.

This year though?  The Rams&#8217; pick is all but a formality.  Ndamukong Suh is a stud at a position the Rams need help with: Defensive Tackle.

I know what  you are saying: &#8220;Woah dude.  We need a quarterback&#8230;and a wide receiver.  Pick those!&#8221;

True, but Suh is a stud and despite Coach Spags&#8217; past work, he might just not be able to squat out a good defense wherever he goes.

Turns out the secret to a good football team is &#8220;good players.&#8221;  Yup.  I know.  Total face palm.  Really should have guessed that.

In that vein&#8230;here&#8217;s to you Ndamukong Suh!
