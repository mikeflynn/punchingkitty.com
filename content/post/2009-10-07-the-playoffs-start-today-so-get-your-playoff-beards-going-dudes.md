[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1913" title="beard3" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/beard3.jpg" alt="beard3" width="600" height="325" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/10/beard3.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/10/beard3-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]Today marks the beginning of the major league baseball playoffs and the Cardinals are back in the mix since their 2006 world series winning campaign. Did you shave last night?  Good.  Now don&#8217;t do it again until the Cards are out of the playoffs, hopefully holding a sweet ass trophy. Its playoff beard time!

This time-honored, hockey invented tradition isn&#8217;t just for the crazy fans, the players get in to it too every year and I love it.  Wainwright was rocking his P.B. right along with me when he froze Beltran with a 12 to 6 curve and back a long time ago we used to have this third baseman Scott Rolen who got injured (again) going in to the playoffs and when asked about his availability for the playoffs he dropped a quote that went something like

> &#8220;I&#8217;m injured and I can&#8217;t play, so I&#8217;ll do what I can to help the team, and right now, that&#8217;s grow a beard.  &#8230;Also Mike Flynn is kickass and I wish I could be him&#8230;just for a day.  God he is _so_ awesome!  I&#8217;d let my wife make out with him.  Wait, what am I saying?!  &#8216;Let her&#8217;?  She so totally wants him. I probably couldn&#8217;t stop her if I wanted to.  For the record though, I wouldn&#8217;t stop her.&#8221;

I&#8217;m paraphrasing, but the beard part is totally true.

You can have all the power-pitching, defense and a sturdy benches, but a playoff beard is a magical thing.  I do the play off beard.  Guess what happened the last time I did it?  Oh nothing&#8230;just a World Series winner for the Cardinals.  Maybe you remember that.  In fact, here&#8217;s a classic video from the archives, that after a long month of rocking the beard-power for the Cards I shaved The Beard.  Enjoy.



I also did them in 2005 and 2004 too, but we don&#8217;t need to talk about those.  I think there were beard calibration issues.  I have them worked out now though.

**Submit Your Beards!**

Throughout the playoffs, I want  you to submit your beards to the site and we will have an ongoing display of all the beardy awesomeness hitting the streets of St. Louis.  Send a photo today for those crucial &#8220;before&#8221; shots!

Email your photos to **tips@punchingkitty.com** and here&#8217;s hoping for an awesome October!

**One last note&#8230;**

<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ryan-franklin.jpg" target="_blank">This kind of crap</a>, although awesome in it&#8217;s own way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn&#8217;t count</span>.  Its got to be a full on, no-trim beard.  On the other side of the coin, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/beard.jpg" target="_blank">if this is you</a>, take it back a notch.
