One of our more keen-eyed tipsters, Andy, emailed in to tell us about a fine little spot for those interested in a cute little place with a wide-open floor plan.

> For Sale!
  
> Feel the excitement and energy of downtown living at its finest!
  
> 44,000+ sq. ft. studio in the heart of the revitalized loft district!
  
> Imagine, your own outdoor jacuzzi / <span>washing machine</span>!  10+ bathrooms!
  
> TIF available, low utility bills, and plenty of nature surround this gem.
  
> Why pay $250,000+ for an overrated apartment with a roof when you can have all of this plus more!
  
> Imagine walking across the street to work panhandling the tourists as they eat their dinner.
  
> Bring out your inner sex offender with downtown&#8217;s newest school just one block away!
> 
> For info contact &#8220;Toofless&#8221; behind 1411 <span>Locust</span> near the sanitation receptacle.
