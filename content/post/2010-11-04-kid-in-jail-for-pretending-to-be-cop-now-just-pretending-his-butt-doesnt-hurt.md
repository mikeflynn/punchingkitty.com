Pulling people over in your Ford Explorer isn&#8217;t on that list.

> Authorities said received to separate complaints on Oct. 14 related to someone possibly impersonating a police officer.
> 
> In both incidents a white male in a Maroon Ford Explorer that was equipped with a dash mounted strobe light pulled someone over in the 14,000 block of Trestle road in Highland, Illinois. In both incidents the suspect identified himself verbally as a &#8220;cop&#8221; and warned one driver to slow down, while warning a second driver for erratic driving.

What&#8217;s the thrill here? Is pulling over someone and telling them that they are driving too fast or erratically while they look back at you with a confused &#8220;Why is this ginger kid telling me this?&#8221; look on their face really that much of a rush? Did he frisk anyone? Nope. Shoot at stuff? Nope. Beat up a minority without fear of conviction? Nope. Sounds like the only cop stuff he did was the boring parts. Did he go home a fill out &#8220;paperwork&#8221; after his make believe time too?

Don&#8217;t waste your time asking why too much though. He&#8217;s a ginger and thus has no soul. The real question is, why the hell anyone would pull over to a maroon Ford Explorer rocking a dashboard strobe light? That&#8217;s just asking to raped, shanked, or raped with a shank.
