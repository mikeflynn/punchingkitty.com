<a rel="attachment wp-att-4453" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/11/the-beautiful-kind-blog-to-return-may-17th/tiny-round-tbk/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4453" title="tiny-round-tbk" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tiny-round-tbk.jpg?filter=resize&w=200" alt="" /></a>We&#8217;ve been hot and heavy, so to speak, with the story about locally based erotic blog The Beautiful Kind&#8217;s sudden disappearance from the interwebs. In our last post, that featured the back story and a message from &#8220;TBK&#8221; herself to our readers, we closed with the following open questions:

> Once again we wish TBK the best going forward and although itâ€™s probably hard for her to look to the future right now, we are left wondering:
> 
> Will the blog be back? Is the interest and drive still there?

Today we got our answer.

According to the video posted on <a href="http://thebeautifulkind.com" target="_blank">The Beautiful Kind.com</a> entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyXPZDWL2ec&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">The Beautiful Kind Issues a Statement</a>&#8221; (embedded below) the site will return on May 17th, less than a week from today.

No other details have been included, but we would assume that TBK will continue to be known publicly by only her nom de plume and stick with the whole anonymous thing, such as it was.

We couldn&#8217;t be happier that TBK is getting back to &#8220;business&#8221; and we look forward to the follow up post on <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/05/learn-about-piss-enemas-and-then-try-the-rest-of-the-day-to-unlearn-it/" target="_blank">people peeing in each others butts</a>.
