1. Has the balls to call out Boston Red Sox baseball and their self-righteous fans?

> For Scott, who was a member of the Orioles when Baltimore beat Boston on the last day of last season to help prevent the Red Sox from making the playoffs, it&#8217;s the second time in as many months he&#8217;s taken a shot at the Sox. During spring training, he said keeping Boston out of the playoffs was even more pleasing because of his disdain for its fans.
> 
> &#8220;Just their arrogance,&#8221; Scott told MLB.com at the time. &#8220;The fans come in and they take over the city. They&#8217;re ruthless, they&#8217;re vulgar, they cause trouble, they talk about your family, swear at you. Who likes that? When people do that, it just gives you more incentive to beat them.

Check.

2. Likes St. Louis?

> &#8220;You go to St. Louis &#8212; classiest fans in the game. You do well, there&#8217;s no vulgarity. You know what? You don&#8217;t wish them bad.&#8221;

Check.

Note to Cardinals: Trade for Luke Scott. He sounds cool.

Wait, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/scottlu01.shtml" target="_blank">never mind</a>. _Don&#8217;t_ trade for Luke Scott&#8230;but he still sounds cool.
