&#8220;Whew! Glad we got our fight settled over that gas can. I should go change though because I have gas all over me in addition to all the booze I&#8217;ve been drinking&#8230;but first I need a light up a smoke. Oh shit. I&#8217;m totally on fire now.&#8221;

That&#8217;s a thing that happened. We ad-libbed the dialog.

> Police tell News 4 the woman and the man she lives with in North St. Louis in the 5200 <span style="color: black; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: small;">block of Beacon </span>had been drinking all day.
> 
> The two got into an argument over a gas can while the man was mowing the lawn, and gas splashed on her. They later resolved their fight.
> 
> Several minutes later, [the] woman lit a cigarette- causing the gas to ignite, engufling [sic] her in flames.

The woman is in critical condition after suffering second and third degree burns on her face and chest. We do hope she&#8217;ll be ok, but let this be a lesson to the rest of you that want to get drunk, have a gas fight and then want to smoke: Pick a maximum of one of those things to do at a time&#8230;maybe you can drink and smoke, but even that ends up with you burning the guy trying to walk behind you at the bar, so just stick to one.
