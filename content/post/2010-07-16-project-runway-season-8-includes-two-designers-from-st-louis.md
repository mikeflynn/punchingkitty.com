Keeping in mind the whole &#8220;kicking lions&#8221; thing we said earlier, we aren&#8217;t afraid to say we watch Project Runway. The one problem with Proj. Run. is that its kind of always the same&#8230;New York, weird designers from the coast, or &#8220;hoosier&#8221; designers from somewhere in the middle.

Imagine our surprise though when we found out that not one, but two, of the up-coming season&#8217;s contestants hailed from St. Louis! We&#8217;ll be sure to keep you non-watchers updated on their progress later on, but lets just start out with some basic &#8220;hellos&#8221;:

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">The new season start on July 29th, on Lifetime. Â Lifetime makes it easy to watch the show and then catch a few stories about how men cheat on, beat and rape everything that has a vagina beating out the last of your manhood&#8230;unless you kick lions right after of course.</span>**
