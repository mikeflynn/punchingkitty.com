Despite what you may have heard from Google (see below) John Goodman, native St. Louisan, isn&#8217;t dead. He&#8217;s just a hell of a lot skinnier than he was.

Bam:<a rel="attachment wp-att-4994" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/06/14/st-louis-native-son-john-goodman-18th-the-man-he-used-to-be/lzq9m/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4994" title="LzQ9M" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/06/LzQ9M.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="500" height="399" /></a>

What is more shocking than Goodman in the tux, is what a disgusting blob he was. Sure, he&#8217;s always been a big boy, but my god. Freaking gross man. How does one even begin to know how to clean effectively under a bitch tit? Lie on your back and dive in I guess&#8230;pretty much on your own too because we&#8217;re pretty sure old Goodman there on the left is taller than us while lying on his back. Â A lot of people say that being fat isn&#8217;t hurting anyone so leave them alone, but say that again face to face with that belt buckle holding on for dear life. That thing is about one Suzy Q away from taking out someone&#8217;s eye.

Whatever. He looks much better now. No word yet on where the Olsen twins will go to keep warm on those cold nights now that the cave under Goodman&#8217;s left boob is gone.

Goodman has a few upcoming projects, but the big one is Pixar&#8217;s _Monster&#8217;s Inc. 2_
