Good news for those of us over the age of 21!  You can drink, and you are still free to text message your friends while driving and potentially threaten the lives of everyone else on the road around you!

> Motorists 21 or younger in Missouri will be prohibited from text messaging while driving starting on Friday, when a new law takes effect. The state will join 22 others in having some sort of prohibition on texting from behind the wheel.

Most states have made laws like this apply to all ages, not just under 21, but not Missouri!  We know that [everyone here over 21 is a perfectly intelligent person][1] that would never do anything to hurt anyone or do anything to endanger the lives of others.  I feel sorry for states like Illinois that have a bunch of adults they can&#8217;t trust so they had to outlaw it for everyone.
