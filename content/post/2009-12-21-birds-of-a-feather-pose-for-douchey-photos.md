It has it all, the guy that throws the peace sign everywhere, the &#8220;I&#8217;ve been rocking this so long it can&#8217;t possibly be ironic any longer&#8221; mustache and a straight up classic &#8220;Me Play Sports Good&#8221; face on young Colby in the middle.

Don&#8217;t get us wrong, Rasmus and Ryan are solid young players, but photos like this make us miss Larry Walker and Reggie Sanders.
