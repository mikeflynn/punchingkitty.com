You know it really sounds like the best way to &#8220;suggest&#8221; new articles to a reader is pull the keywords from a headline and then search your back stories. Simple!

Example: &#8220;Man Gives Out Puppies to Poor Kids&#8221;

Find the keywords: &#8220;Man Gives Out **Puppies** to Poor **Kids**&#8220;

Go get some other fun stories about **puppies** and **kids**. Everyone wins!

Turns out not so simple as our tipster found out:

The suggested stories on &#8220;What a Great Father-Son Project&#8221; were:

&#8220;City worker fired after being connected to teens death&#8221; and &#8220;East St. Louis man charged with DUI in wreck that killed son&#8221; &#8230;hence the sad face with only one eye crying.

Such is life in St. Louis that even things related to making stuff with your son leads to a bring down. Probably shouldn&#8217;t even waste your time and just drink heavily, throwing the empties at your kid. Get him prepared for that hard St. Louis living.
