According to [StlMedia.net][1] (who refuses to have proper blogging software and thus has no permalinks to correctly link to) and the [New York Post][2], ClearChannel, the radio company that in St. Louis operates z107.7, 93.7 The Bull, Majic 104.9, KLOU 103.3 and 100.3 The Beat, is planning a large &#8220;reduction in force&#8221; which is the new cool executive way to say &#8220;lay offs.&#8221;  Doesn&#8217;t it sound much better?

From the New York Post:

> According to three sources with knowledge of the plan, the restructuring will include layoffs across the company&#8217;s radio, outdoor advertising and international divisions as well as cuts to programming budgets and consolidation of back-office operations.
> 
> A precise headcount for the layoffs could not be obtained. Clear Channel has about 30,000 employees worldwide.
> 
> The company is also likely to move toward a &#8220;national programming&#8221; model that would require less local-level staffing, despite being criticized in the past for a similar action using centralized disc jockeys that made it appear as though they were broadcasting from local stations.

>   Sources said an initial round of layoffs is expected to commence next Tuesday &#8211; not coincidentally the same day President-elect <a class="topiclink" href="http://www.nypost.com/topics/topic.php?t=Barack+Obama">Barack Obama</a> is to be sworn into office. Clear Channel managers are hoping they can slip in the layoffs while the press is preoccupied with Inauguration Day festivities, sources said.

> A Clear Channel spokeswoman declined to comment.

Once again, a bunch of old white guys trying to get away with something bad by using a black man a distraction.
