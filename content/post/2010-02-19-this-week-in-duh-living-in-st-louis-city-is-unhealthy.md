Guess what?!  _Another_ study came out saying that living in St. Louis city proper is a death wish!

> Residents of St. Charles County have the best opportunities in Missouri to be healthy, while people who live in St. Louis city have the worst, according to a new report.
> 
> To compile the report, researchers looked at data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the FBI, the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources.

So St. Charles is the healthiest place in Missouri huh?  Factor in the fact that its boring as hell there and then tell me where the place to live is. You want to live forever in Pleasantville, or do you want to live fast and hard and leave a somewhat attractive corpse after dodging omnipresent random gun fire, street fights and enough venereal disease to take down Ron Jeremy?!

That&#8217;s what I thought&#8230;bitch.  High five!

Now lets go get tats.  &#8230;dibs on a bunny!
