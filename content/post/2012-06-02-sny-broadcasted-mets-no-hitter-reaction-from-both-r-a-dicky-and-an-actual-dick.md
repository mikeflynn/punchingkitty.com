  So the Cardinals got no-hit last night by the Mets&#8230;which sucks&#8230;and it&#8217;s even bigger news than a &#8220;regular&#8221; no-hitter since it&#8217;s the first one ever for the Mets, so it&#8217;s all over the news&#8230;which sucks more.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Sliver lining: While interviewing today&#8217;s Mets&#8217; piture about the no-hitter, Mets channel SNY accidentally broadcast a full set of dick and balls.

  Here&#8217;s the screenshot as uploaded to Reddit by &#8220;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/pminkin">pminkin</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/uh6ad/ra_dickey_interviewed_after_the_mets_no_hitter/" target="_blank">earlier today</a> (which we&#8217;ve edited by drawing a cartoon dick over the actual dick&#8230;not R.A. <em>Dick</em>ey, he&#8217;s suitable for broadcast, just the penis.):

<p style="text-align: left;">
  By the looks of this photo neither of the Dickeys are all that excited about the no-hitter. Geez. You&#8217;d think you&#8217;d show a little team pride and get pumped up a little!

  <strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/thedeejus">thedeejus</a> added this investigation to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/uh6ad/ra_dickey_interviewed_after_the_mets_no_hitter/c4vf7hb" target="_blank">the comments on the Reddit post</a>. Not entirely scientific, but it&#8217;s a better guess that we could come up with on the owner of the photo-bombing penis:
</p>

> Well, let&#8217;s do this CIS style:
> 
> The clues:
> 
> Team: Mets. Possible culprits: 25
> 
> Since he is showering that day, it likely narrows it down to one of the ten players who appeared in Friday night&#8217;s game.
> 
> Race: White. Torres, Santana, Quintanilla &#8211; you&#8217;re out.
> 
> Penis status: circumcised (I&#8217;m looking at you, Ike Davis)
> 
> Pubes status: shorn. The penis is likely attached to an unmarried player who still feels as though he needs to impress the ladies
> 
> Height: Unknown, BUT we can see that the top of his penis stands at precisely 5.5 blue bricks from the ground, less 5 x 1 inch = 5 inches for the caulk (heh) between the bricks. Assuming these are painted cinder blocks, which run 8 x 8 x 16 inches, we can infer that his hips are 39 inches from the ground. The top of my own penis stands 36.5 inches from the ground, and at 5&#8217;11&#8221;, that runs at a ratio of 51.4% of my height. Extrapolating that ratio to 39 inches, our penissy pal likely stands approximately 6&#8217;3 and 3/4&#8243;.
> 
> Handedness: Left (in the video, the player can be seen to be carrying a towel in his left hand, and his right hand to be empty).
> 
> Discussion: We have on our hands a left-handed, caucasian, 6&#8217;4&#8243; circumcised player from Friday night&#8217;s game.
> 
> Conclusion: The only caucasian, unmarried, left-handed throwing player from last night&#8217;s game was Ike Davis, who is unmarried, stands 6&#8217;4&#8243; and is Jewish (i.e., likely circumcised).
> 
> TL;DR: **IKE FUCKING DAVIS**
