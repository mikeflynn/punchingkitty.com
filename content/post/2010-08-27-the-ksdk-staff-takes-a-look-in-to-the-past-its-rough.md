KSDK.com&#8217;s little sister site MomsLikeMe.com recently took a look back with some old photos from the KSDK staff&#8217;s past.

Some are quite cute, like little **Kay Quinn** in her Hawaiian outfit:

Next up? **Art Holliday**, the target of all spilled affection on the Art Holliday Facebook Fan Club. We had no idea he was a Little Rascal.

Sports guy turned anchor **Mike Bush**! A few things to note in this picture: 1. His hair wasn&#8217;t always varnished down like that! 2. It appears Mike was staring in the gay porn version of Gilligan&#8217;s Island when this photo was taken.

Lastly, just so we don&#8217;t leave you with a confused Leisa Zigman chubby, here&#8217;s **Jennifer Blome**&#8216;s creepy eyes peering in to your soul. She knows all about you and those eyes see everything. Even when you poop.

Enjoy the news tonight!
