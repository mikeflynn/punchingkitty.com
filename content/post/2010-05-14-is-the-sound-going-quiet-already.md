St. Louis&#8217; newest station 100.3 The Sound, owned by ClearChannel might be gone before it ever really got started according to a source of <a href="http://stlmediastuff.blogspot.com/2010/05/will-ccs-sound-become-classic-1003.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MikeAndersonsStlmedianet+%28Mike+Anderson%27s+STLMedia.net%29" target="_blank">STLMedia.net</a>:

> Clear Channel is very close to selling/donating 100.3 to one of the groups that tried to stop the KFUO transfer. Its a double win for Clear Channel, triple if you consider that The Sound is a complete failure. All of this is being done with San Antonio because of the complex nature of the deal, but it could be done by July 4th.

You can think music radio has a future all you want, but there&#8217;s no denying that it&#8217;s damn near impossible to make any money at it.

We didn&#8217;t actually mind The Sound all that much, but did we listen to it? No, not really. Only when we forgot to bring our iPod in the car.
