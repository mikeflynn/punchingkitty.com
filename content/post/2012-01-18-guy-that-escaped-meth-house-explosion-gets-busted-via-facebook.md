A meth lab explosion in Cahokia ended with two men arrested soon after and a third, Gary Morrison, who initially eluded capture, and found the time to update his Facebook profile with a photo of his charred face. A photo that police say will definitely be used against him in his up-coming court case.

> &#8220;It is one of the few times in my 20-year law enforcement career when we have gathered evidence like this using Facebook,&#8221; Detective Joe Beliveau said.

&#8230;which would stand to reason, since Facebook has only been around for 8 years. At the time we&#8217;re sure this sounded like an interesting quote from a long-time law man, but it really doesn&#8217;t make sense or carry much weight when you think about it. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;In my 20 years of Policin&#8217; I&#8217;ve never seen a man killed while wearing a shirt that says &#8216;The Current Year is 2012&#8217;. Wild stuff!&#8221;

Along with a photo of his blistered face, Gary also included a pretty decent caption:

> &#8220;I will tell you exactly what he posted.  He said &#8216;look at my face, it can meth you up,'&#8221; Beliveau said.

Pretty good right?! That&#8217;s a way better line than we would have assumed a meth-cooker could come up with and we would have loved to drop an awkward &#8220;Like&#8221; button click on that comment&#8230;but then felt weird about it and &#8220;Un-liked&#8221; real quick to make sure it didn&#8217;t already show up on our profile because what am I &#8220;liking&#8221; there? Meth usage? The funny comment? Sure we could do a comment explaining our like, but that&#8217;s so lame. Facebook is hard.

Alas the incriminating photo is no longer on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003102396758" target="_blank">Gary&#8217;s profile</a>, but his hilarious linking to &#8220;Hard Knocks University&#8221; in the education section remains. He also left up his &#8220;awesome&#8221; picture of Jesus arm wrestling Satan in the clouds photo and judging by Gary&#8217;s meth facial and current incarceration we can probably guess that Jesus could stand to do a little more upper body work in the gym.
