We remember Chris Pronger, we just don&#8217;t remember him having such a great ass and set of gams! Rrrrrrrow!

That pull out poster appeared in the Chicago Tribune just after game 5 of the Stanley Cups finals. Some have called it tasteless, others have said &#8220;What the hell is hockey?&#8221;, but when asked directly, Pronger himself only had this to say: &#8220;I don&#8217;t read what you guys write. Good or bad.&#8221;Â That&#8217;s right! With a can like that Chrissy shouldn&#8217;t be wasting his time reading stuff, he should be out there shaking was the Tribune gave him!
