The move conicides with the earlier removal of major airline hubs, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/12/06/guy-runs-from-lamber-tsas-totally-gets-away-with-it/" target="_blank">any semblance of security</a>, and decent flights that don&#8217;t involve  you going the wrong direction for 6 hours to get to a _real_ airport to make your connecting flight.

> [T]he city will close — and eventually tear down — the five airport smoking lounges on Jan. 2, the day most public places in the city must go smoke-free.
> 
> [Mayor] Slay had said last year he would do as much. Then, late last week, he said in an interview with the Post-Dispatch that the city had worked out conflicts with the county smoking ban, which exempts the lounges.

> He said his first priority is the health of travelers and airport workers, but the move is also about the city&#8217;s reputation.

Good move. We&#8217;d hate to have a reputation here in St. Louis that <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/11/22/st-louis-regains-title-of-most-dangerous-city/" target="_blank">it isn&#8217;t healthy to live here</a>. We think that maybe we should just let people heading in to the city take a pitstop for a quick smoke. Give them a blindfold too, and then send them out in to the mean St. Louis streets.
