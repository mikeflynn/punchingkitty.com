> More than 30 manhole covers have gone missing in East St. Louis in the past few months.
> 
> Their value at metal scrap yards have made them a hot commodity. But the holes they&#8217;re leaving behind are creating several issues.

The city is trying to combat the problem by installing locking covers and installing security cameras, but those solutions are too late for the several problems the open sewer hole are causing as earlier this week, an 11-year old boy fell down an open sewer when the hole was covered in snow.

Sadly unexpected holes are a common problem in East St. Louis, as many of its more &#8220;adult&#8221; visitors don&#8217;t realize that it isn&#8217;t always a mouth on the other side of the gloryhole.
