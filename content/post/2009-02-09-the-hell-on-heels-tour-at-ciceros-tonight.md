Its Monday, you know you don&#8217;t have anything to do right?  Then head on out to The Loop tonight at 8p to see one of the most exciting bands on the planet: [Semi Precious Weapons][1].  _[Note: No slouch themselves, One Lone Car will be there as well.]_

Yeah, I know, they are playing small venues here, but its just because the STL is a little behind the &#8220;Cool Times&#8221; (and you know this). 

Here&#8217;s some video of one of the last times they were in town playing at The Pageant:

Part One:
  


Part Two:
  


The show is at Cicero&#8217;s with doors at 8pm with tickets for $10.

Of course, we will be there taking as many photos and video as we can before getting tossed so hunt us down if you have something to share!  Lets talk!
