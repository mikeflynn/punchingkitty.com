We kinda accidentally, sorta took a day off last night when we didn&#8217;t write anything. That&#8217;s OK though, because our friends at Joe Sports Fan picked us up and took care of the important stuff: Making fun of Mayor Slay.

Apparently Mayor Slay, in addition to the rest of the things he&#8217;s horrible at like &#8220;being a mayor&#8221;, is also horrible at making and going through with small pointless bets. <a href="http://www.joesportsfan.com/cardinals/mayor-slay-dc-san-francisco-bets/" target="_blank">Joe Sports Fan has the whole rundown</a>, but in short: He won&#8217;t go to any trouble other than taking a picture of his TV when he loses, and won&#8217;t spring for better shipping when he actually wins the bet.

It&#8217;s almost like he lost a bet to be the mayor of St. Louis&#8230;wait&#8230;a&#8230;minute&#8230;it all makes so much sense now!
