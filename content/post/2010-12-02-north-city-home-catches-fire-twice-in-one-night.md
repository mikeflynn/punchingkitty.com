They all then climb in the car and go head out to get some stuff to clean up the mess&#8230;while they were out a second, more serious fire started.Â The first fire is a completely clear cut accident, but are suspicious of the second fire, mainly because the gas and electricity were still turned off from the first fire.

If we believed in karma we might be wondering how many puppies this family kicked in the face to deserve this, but we don&#8217;t because that crap is stupid and lots of puppies have kickable faces.
