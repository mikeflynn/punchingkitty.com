Late Friday afternoon, after exchanging emails with an assignment editor, KSDK reporter Ashley Yarchin came to Punching Kitty headquarters to do a story about our recent post &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/01/craigslist-anyone-seen-the-cardinals-team-we-had-in-april" target="_blank">Craigslist: Anyone Seen the Cardinals Team We Had in April?</a>&#8221; and in turn, Punching Kitty the blog.

Once setting up all the one-man-show reporter gear in our office we talked on camera about when I started Punching Kitty, what its about, then specifically about the Craigslist post followed by a dramatic reading of my posting. I mentioned the name of the site several times, we positioned shots so that the logo and name were on screen and when she left I gave her a sticker. Below is the piece KSDK aired Friday night during their 10 pm broadcast. Watch it like you don&#8217;t read this site and then see if you know where to go to find more of my writing&#8230;

Not one freaking mention. The first thing everyone has asked me about this was &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you mention the name of the site?&#8221; Oh I did. I did indeed. Not only that, but there was some pretty impressive editing to get out all the environmental mentions in my office. My two monitors were filled with Punching Kitty&#8217;s logo and name, my &#8220;idea&#8221; board you can see in a few shots had it on there, and I have well over, and not kidding, 300 Punching Kitty stickers sprinkled on my desk. In fact, upon close inspection, there are two &#8220;accidental plugs&#8221; KSDK left in:

#1 When they showed the Craigslist ad:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6618" title="ksdk_accidental_plug_1" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/09/ksdk_accidental_plug_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="329" />][1]

#2 When they showed a wider shot of my desk, there is a Punching Kitty sticker on my monitor. You can&#8217;t make it out here, but it might be been a little something in High-Def&#8230;on a 60&#8243; TV.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6617" title="ksdk_accidental_plug_2" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/09/ksdk_accidental_plug_2.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="335" />][2]Even throughout the interview, it was clear that the point of the piece was about my blog. &#8220;How long have you been doing your blog?&#8221; &#8220;What is it about?&#8221; &#8220;What are you going to do next on there?&#8221; &#8220;Lets make sure we get this shot with the logo so we can get you a plug right?&#8221; All were direct quotes&#8230;none mattered once the piece aired. Lame KSDK. Very very lame.

I guess the important thing is that you filled out a slot in your Friday night &#8220;We don&#8217;t give a shit, put the JV anchor crew out there&#8221; newscast. Your main audience of people waiting to die was happy that they saw something about baseball and no one got offended or overly entertained which is the important thing&#8230;second only to finishing another day with out Leisa Zigmann&#8217;s nose falling off her face.

Jokes aside, I&#8217;m really not angered by this as much as I feel duped. Flat out, had they said from the beginning &#8220;We will not mention the name of your site.&#8221; **I wouldn&#8217;t have done the piece.** No malice behind that (at least at the time), it&#8217;s just that I didn&#8217;t want to have to run home on a Friday and take time out of my day to do this if there wasn&#8217;t going to be a promotional value in it. This site is growing at a crazy rate these days. It is well-read, especially for a locally-focused site and because of that I&#8217;m not at all worried about &#8220;just being on TV&#8221;, I only agreed due to the inherit promotion to keep this site growing at its current rate. In the grand scheme of things, the piece KSDK produced was a fine fluffy Friday-evening story that hurt no one, but that&#8217;s not at all how it was brought to me. Frankly that&#8217;s more than a little slimy, but looks worse on KSDK that this is the kind of games they have to play to fill 30 minutes these days.

A few final unstructured notes on this subject:

&#8211; Yes, I 100% realize the time constraints involved in something like this, but using that as an excuse to cut out every Punching Kitty reference is BS. I certainly wasn&#8217;t thinking this was going to be 5 minutes of our logo, but after my dealings with Yarchin I thought at _worst_ I would get &#8220;Punching Kitty.com&#8221; under my name in the lower third. Nope. Nothing.

&#8211; One good &#8220;Old Media&#8221; thing I should note is that earlier in the day, Friday, our same story was mentioned in Derrick Goold&#8217;s great <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_00e9d2da-b770-11df-86b6-00127992bc8b.html" target="_blank">10@10 post on STLToday</a>. It originally appeared uncredited, but after myself and a few others reached out the Goold, he updated his post with attribution to this site and <a href="http://twitter.com/dgoold/status/22904699638" target="_blank">apologized via Twitter</a>. He&#8217;s a class act, and an actual journalist who wants to source things correctly. Thanks again Derrick, we really appreciate it.

&#8211; Despite our brief interactions, I don&#8217;t think this was Yarchin&#8217;s call. Maybe I&#8217;m still being a little duped here, but I&#8217;m guessing the final editing of everything with Punching Kitty came from higher up. Is there a rule in place where you can&#8217;t mention outside sites? Maybe (let me know if you know something), but not long ago this very site was mentioned on KSDK.com on a story about the Crown Candy Malt record: &#8220;<a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=202115" target="_blank">Crown Candy malt record still stands, but whose name goes on plaque?</a>&#8221; Too bad the author, Mike Owens, is leaving KSDK. He appears to be the only one that know how this whole &#8220;sourcing&#8221; thing works.

&#8211; I emailed Ashley Yarchin Friday right after the piece aired to thank her for the time, but also explain my frustrations. No response yet.

&#8211; Oh yes, <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=214846" target="_blank">the online version</a>! I almost forgot! No mention or link there either. I tried to comment on the story to leave a link back here and it was promptly removed. Stay classy butt-wipes. &#8230;people still say &#8220;butt-wipe&#8221; don&#8217;t they?

Can you just link to our site instead of putting the video on your site though?&#8221; Yeah, gonna get right on that.
