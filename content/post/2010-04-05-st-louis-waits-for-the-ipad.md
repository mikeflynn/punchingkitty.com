It&#8217;s 6:45am and I&#8217;m walking in to the West County Mall with a b-line for the Apple store.  The glass front of the Apple store is shrouded in darkness with black curtains covering the front of the store while I can only assume the little Apple elves are scurrying around sprinkling the last bits of magic dust on the iPads. I will be only the third person in the &#8220;reservation&#8221; line, but counting the other line of unwashed &#8220;no reservation&#8221; people I&#8217;m probably closer to the 30 or 40th person total. The guys ahead of me are claiming they were in line at 11pm last night, which at the time I found hard to believe. Later on I found that the two of them and their dog slept in a car parked in the mall lot and walked in when the mall opened at 5am.  An hour later I find out that one of the two guys ahead of me is just along for the ride, making me the second iPad purchaser in line. So close to #1! I don&#8217;t feel bad being bested by the guy though, he has waited in line for the iPhone and Xbox 360 previously. He&#8217;s a pro.

I didn&#8217;t have the guts to stray too far from my spot so the other line remains a mystery to me especially considering these people had the wherewithal to show up at a mall in the wee hours of the morning but not take the 15 seconds to reserve one online.

The line has received a few odd looks from mall walkers, but honestly are we any more weird than someone that wakes up at 5am for no reason other than to put on a garish sweatsuit and walk around in a mall with no stores open? All in all though, people are quite nice to us line people. Apple employees bring us water, a fellow line-mate brought 2 dozen doughnuts to share. California Pizza Kitchen came by offering breakfast pizza. No one knows if it&#8217;s free or not. No one takes any.

Soon after we get the first contact from Apple. Apple-guy tells us they will give us line-people free coffee. I don&#8217;t drink coffee. A guy two down from me toting a Windows laptop, which to me is a turd in the Apple punchbowl today, high-fived him over&#8230;wait for it&#8230;the availability of cases.

Soon we enter to the cheers and high-fives of Apple&#8217;s employees and, though I can&#8217;t hear them, my credit card company executives.

Oh, and the iPad is great.
