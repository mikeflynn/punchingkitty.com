There were no storms Thursday mind you, so in essence it was a &#8220;If you&#8217;re hearing this, you survived!&#8221; alarm. We don&#8217;t have any hard numbers, but it seems more celebratory, while somewhat less effective.

> Michelle Kidwell, the county&#8217;s emergency management director, says a glitch in the warning system caused the delay. Kidwell says residents should have received a phone call with the weather warning on Wednesday and that the system was being examined so that repairs could be made.

A phone call? Local government is calling people now about severe weather? How lovely.

_[Wavy lines so you know this is where we tilt our head up and think of what that might be like in a hopefully entertaining fashion. Maybe you could wave your hands around in front of you to complete the illusion. Seriously. Do it. Now!]_
