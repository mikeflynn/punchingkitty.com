Is it just us that seems like way too many accidents happen where someone drives in to the side of someone&#8217;s freaking house?

Its one thing to take out a mailbox or whatever, but it seems like at least once or twice a year some retard drives in to someone&#8217;s freaking house&#8230;right in the the freaking side of it&#8230;like what happened yesterday as reported (kinda, I mean there was nothing really about it on the page at the time of this writing) [by KSDK][2].

Sure they could have been drink, but still&#8230;seems like there would lot of other things to hit before one would get to the house.
