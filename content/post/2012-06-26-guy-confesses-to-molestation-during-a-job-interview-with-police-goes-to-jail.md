So here&#8217;s a thing that totally happened: A man was interviewing for a job with the Missouri State Highway Patrol and during the interview process he was asked if he had ever engaged in a sexual crime he could be convicted of. Which is one of those &#8220;Do I look stupid? Like I&#8217;m going to just say yes to that&#8230;to the freaking police!&#8221;

Oh but he did.

&#8230;and the funny thing about confessing to child molestation crimes is there aren&#8217;t any points for honesty.

> Christopher Stringham, 26, of Park Hills, has been charged with 20 counts of first-degree statutory sodomy.
> 
> Stringham told the interviewing sergeant about inappropriately touching a child several times. He implied it was an accident each time.
> 
> After the interview, other law enforcement agencies were contacted. Park Hills Police attempted to interview Stringham further.

&#8220;Ok Mr. Stringham everything looks good so far, so lets run through the formality of these last few questions and we&#8217;ll call you soon.&#8221;

&#8220;Great.&#8221;

&#8220;Have you ever committed a drug related crime?&#8221;

&#8220;Nope.&#8221;

&#8220;Ok. Have you ever committed murder?&#8221;

&#8220;I sure haven&#8217;t!&#8221;

&#8220;Of course you haven&#8217;t. Last one, have you ever engaged in a sexual crime you could be convicted of?&#8221;

_&#8220;It&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;ll just tell them the truth and how me fondling that kid was a total accident that happened **20 times**, and they&#8217;ll respect me for my honesty and hire me on the spot. Oh man this is going to be great! Officer Stringham has a wonderful ring to it. Oh man, maybe I&#8217;ll get to be a crossing guard!_ &#8230;Well, sir. There was this one or twenty times I touched a kid, but it was a total accident. You know how those things are! Anyway, it was pretty bad. When do I get by gun and my kid poking stick? What&#8217;s the name of those things again? &#8216;Little Billy Club&#8217; or something?&#8221;
