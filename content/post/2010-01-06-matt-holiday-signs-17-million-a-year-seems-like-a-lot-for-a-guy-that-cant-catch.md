The Cardinals have finally sealed the deal!  It took a lot of dinners and getting their had slapped away from some boobs, but after a weekend of some heavy petting, the finally went all the way and got the deal done with the apple of their offseason&#8217;s eye, Matt Holiday.

Holliday announced the deal himself on ESPN Radio yesterday. (No, not the St. Louis version 101 ESPN, the national version.  Bitch slap!)

> &#8220;Well, I think first of all going into free agency I had in the back of my mind that I really liked my time in St. Louis and felt it was a good fit for me and my family,&#8221; Holliday said on the show.
> 
> He added: &#8220;At the end of the day we decided that was best for us.&#8221;

He followed up with: &#8220;Oh, and they were the only ones really bidding for me and they still gave me a sh*t load of money!  Ka-kow!&#8221;

The deal for the nearly 30 year old (Jan 15th) Holliday is for 7 years and roughly $120 million, giving him an average of $17 million dollars a year.

More from Holliday:

> &#8220;When you&#8217;re a little kid growing up hoping to be a professional baseball player and hoping to play in the major leagues, I don&#8217;t think you ever think about the money,&#8221; Holliday said. &#8220;Now that you look at it, it&#8217;s a little overwhelming.&#8221;

We&#8217;ll take some Matt.  Don&#8217;t want you feeling uncomfortable.
