&#8230;kinda.  You can smoke inside, if you operate a cigar bar or tobacco shop, or are in one of the 20% of hotel rooms that can still allow it, and of course patios.

&#8230;or actually its still cool if you are in _any_ currently established public place until July, 1st 2010.

But other than that, smoke free!

> &#8220;This is a historic moment for the city of Clayton,&#8221; Mayor Linda Goldstein said.
> 
> Clayton joins Ballwin as the only municipalities of the 91 in St. Louis County to have a ban. Arnold in Jefferson County also prohibits smoking in public places. Illinois has a statewide ban.

The pressure is now on the surrounding areas to add smoking bans as well, like University City.  Pfffft.  You know since there really aren&#8217;t any skinny jeans-wearing, chain smoking hipsters that hang out in University City every weekend.  Shouldn&#8217;t be an issue there.
