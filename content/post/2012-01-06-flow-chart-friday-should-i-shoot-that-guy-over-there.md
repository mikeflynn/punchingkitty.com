  It&#8217;s a question that pops in to the heads of many a St. Louis area resident: &#8220;Should I should that guy over there?&#8221; It&#8217;s not always an easy question, so going forward, use this handy flow chart to decide.

  The original version had a part where it asked if you were from a drug-addled neighborhood in North City, and if so, proceed directly to &#8220;Shoot him!&#8221; but we took it out because if people from drug-addled neighborhoods in North City can&#8217;t read, so there&#8217;s really no point.
