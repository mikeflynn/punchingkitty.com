When will the hatred stop? What did these harmless little nocturnal creatures ever do to you? They just want to love you&#8230;is that so much to ask?

Please leave computer nerds alone 18 year old girls. Laughing when they ask you to the prom is plenty of pain. There&#8217;s no need to start crashing your cars through the front windows of computer repair stores!

> Police said a vehicle smashed into Tony&#8217;s Computer Shop in the 1200 block of South Duchesne at about 2:30 p.m. A witness said the driver is an 18-year-old girl who was taken away in an ambulance and then returned to the scene.

Witness, as told to KMOV, said that the car &#8220;suddenly ramped over the parking curb and into the building.&#8221; luckily the only nerd inside was unharmed wile in a back room working&#8230;or looking at porn. Other than the use of a joystick, the two tasks are indistinguishable.
