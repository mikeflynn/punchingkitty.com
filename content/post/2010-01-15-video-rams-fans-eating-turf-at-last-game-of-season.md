We already <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/04/rams-injure-fans-on-fan-appreciation-day/" target="_blank">talked about this</a>, but we found the video and just _had_ to share.

Turns out after this incident occured the Rams said it was all on purpose! Â They claim the two fans signed up for something called the &#8220;Rams Quaterback Experience&#8221; which entails you getting badly hurt while an actual Rams offensive lineman watches.
