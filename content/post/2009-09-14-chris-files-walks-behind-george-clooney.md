Is that Chris Files, host of [The Toast][1] which is the diamond in the rough that is ToastedRav.com, in the [new Up in the Air trailer][2] walking behind star George Clooney?

It sure is!

Things are looking good for Files to make it in to the final cut of the movie when it drops November 13th which is pretty cool&#8230;I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t as much of a thrill as it was working with me doing [Don&#8217;t Puke videos][3], but still, pretty exciting.
