&#8211; What an odd choice of a song to walk Pujols out to.

&#8211; Julio Franco was the player of choice for little Albert?

&#8211; Wow. Forgot how much this guy needs a spanglish translator.

&#8211; Dave asked him what team is &#8220;laughable&#8221;, but Pujols didn&#8217;t answer. You were thinking of the Pirates Albert.

&#8211; &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to guess [on the pitch coming].&#8221;

&#8211; Pujols is getting a few laughs.

&#8211; Pujols&#8217; kid is playing &#8220;kid pitch&#8221; little league ball. He gets angry when he strikes out.

&#8211; Dennis Leary is going to pitch. Here&#8217;s hoping Albert takes his head with that Red Sox hat clean off.

&#8211; Haven&#8217;t watched Letterman in a while. He&#8217;s usually funnier than this isn&#8217;t he?

&#8211; Letterman is up first. He&#8217;s not good. Leary is worse though.

&#8211; Pujols takes the first pitch from Leary. Good eye.

&#8211; Leary hit Pujols. Charge that bitch!

&#8211; It was a pretty quick batting practice. Kind of a waste of time. A few good hits though.

Pujols came off looking great. Good in front of the camera. At the end he looked right in to the camera and said &#8220;Mets, Yankees&#8230;you got a year and a half.&#8221; We kid.
