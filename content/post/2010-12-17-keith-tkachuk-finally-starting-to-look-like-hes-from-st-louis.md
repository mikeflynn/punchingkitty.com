> One of the greatest American-born hockey players ever, Tkachuk was never known as a svelte dude. But just eight months after retirement, he&#8217;s looking like he still wears his pads under his dress shirt.

Lost some teeth and found some pounds! Replace that dress shirt with a polo embroidered with the logo of your local wooden pallet supplier, throw in some Crocs, and his St. Louis make-over is complete!

We know Tkachuk, former Blue and the guy St. Louis adopted from Boston, is going under at least one more surgury to fix his shattered front teeth, but until then, maybe go with the closed-mouth smile.
