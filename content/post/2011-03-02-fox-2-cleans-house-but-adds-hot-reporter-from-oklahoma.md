_9:45am &#8212; Updated to reflect more information clarifying John Auble&#8217;s status._

A couple of interesting and corroborating reports in our tip line inbox today about the two-headed local news team of **Fox2** and **KPLR** (11). According to both our tipster and our other source, spring cleaning is in full effect in the on-air news department by both traditional firings and medical leave. Here&#8217;s a summary of what we&#8217;ve heard, starting with the slightly stale news and going from there:

A few days ago #2 or #3 sports guy **<a href="http://www.fox2now.com/ktvi-robdesir-825400,0,2420787.story" target="_blank">Rob Desir</a>** disappeared from the station, but now reporter **<a href="http://www.fox2now.com/about/station/newsteam/ktvi-seanconroy-825275,0,5957190.story" target="_blank">Sean Conroy</a>,** who had been rumored to be &#8220;leaving&#8221; to focus on the bars he co-owns (<a href="http://www.internationaltaphouse.com/" target="_blank">iTap</a>), is gone as well. Fellow reporters **<a href="http://www.fox2now.com/about/station/newsteam/ktvi-johngadson-825446,0,1439785.story" target="_blank">John Gadsen</a>** and **John Auble** both would have also been shown the door according to our tipster, but are currently on the mend from major illness. On the KPLR side, rumor has it that **Melanie Moon**&#8216;s job may be on thin ice as well&#8230;which brings us to the news team&#8217;s recent hire: **Angie Mock**. Who by the way, isn&#8217;t bad on the eyes:

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Mock hasn&#8217;t listed the move from Oklahoma City to St. Louis on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1652421703" target="_blank">her Faacebook page</a> yet, but <a href="http://www.okcfox.com/newsroom/morning_news/videos/vid_1989.shtml" target="_blank">she did announce it on the morning show</a> she still co-hosts for the next couple of days.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Could Mock the less hard news experienced Mock be in line for the KPLR job if the cuts continue? Our tipster thinks so, but we couldn&#8217;t back that up other than confirming Mock&#8217;s hire. On the whole though, these cuts make sense in a trimming the books way because all of the names listed have been at the station for a while, so they make a little more money, but also aren&#8217;t &#8220;key&#8221; on-air faces most people will miss. Sadly, these moves were probably the &#8220;easy&#8221; decisions.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  No formal confirmation on KTVI/KPLR at the time of this writing other than Rob Desir&#8217;s page being removed from the &#8220;<a href="http://www.fox2now.com/about/station/newsteam/" target="_blank">News Team</a>&#8221; page.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In a related story, Fox2 is advertising the fact that they have &#8220;the most meteorologists&#8221; in the market, which means if you work for Fox2 start brushing up on how to point to stuff on a green screen and highlighting green and red splotches on a map while telling everyone those are tornados. Nah, <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/02/28/no-tornadoes-say-weather-experts/" target="_blank">it doesn&#8217;t really matter if you&#8217;re right</a>.

  We hadn&#8217;t really focused on her face yet, but yeah&#8230;she kinda does.
