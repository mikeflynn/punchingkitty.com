Another man was gunned down at a MetroLink station last Friday, but lets not focus on that says a MetroLink spokesman, lets focus on all the times people don&#8217;t die! Pay no attention to the woefully inadequate security guard, security is fine!

> Metro officials say they spend millions each year on security, with dispatchers monitoring all 37 platforms all day and night.

Quoting how much you spend each year isn&#8217;t a good defense to the argument that security sucks&#8230;it just proves you wasted a lot of money during the suckage.

> &#8220;Sometimes our dispatchers will see something on the platform that looks suspicious,&#8221; said Richard Zott, head of Metro security. &#8220;So they&#8217;ll call it out to the platform guy saying, &#8216;Hey, there&#8217;s a suspicious individual &#8212; go check him out.'&#8221;

&#8220;I mean, the guy he just stabbed is still gonna die, but the important thing is that we saw it with a grainy still frame and we sent the old woman security guard, armed with a flash light and whistle, out to go take a look.&#8221;

> &#8220;If someone commits a crime, we can zoom in, get a still photograph and pass that out,&#8221; Zott said.

&#8220;&#8230;again, none of this is actually preventing the crime, but you should see our scrapbook!&#8221;

MetroLink is what it is. It doesn&#8217;t run late enough to use while going out, it doesn&#8217;t go to enough places, and no matter what the stats do or don&#8217;t say, it&#8217;s hard to describe your situation as &#8220;safe&#8221; while riding it&#8230;but if where you want to go is near a station and it&#8217;s during the day, it&#8217;s a nice solution. To pretend it&#8217;s anything else is just living with your head in the sand, but this story doesn&#8217;t change that. What&#8217;s interesting is that they are spending &#8220;millions&#8221; on securing just 37 platforms, and that their own spokesman thinks that the best time to announce that their security is &#8220;adequate&#8221; is just three days after a murder on a MetroLink platform.

You know what&#8217;s _not_ interesting? If you mix orange soda with root beer, it will taste like shit but you could call it something fun like &#8220;A Carrot&#8221; because it&#8217;s an orange root.
