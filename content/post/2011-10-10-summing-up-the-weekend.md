Cardinals, Cardinals, Cardinals! From Squirrels to dancing on a broken Ryan Howard, to a defeat by the Brewers, this weekend was all Cardinals, all the time. Even we succumbed to the fever by live-blogging the <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/10/07/cardinals-nlds-game-5/" target="_blank">NLDS Game 5 </a>and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/10/09/cardinals-nlcs-game-1/" target="_blank">NLCS Game 1</a>. We didn&#8217;t go all in and paint our face like a giant red Cardinals baseball, like this guy, but we just decided to wear our red Cardinals hat instead of our stupid green one. Just seemed easier.

Friday&#8217;s game went great by the way, even though ESPN was pretty sure we were going down:

ESPN was pretty rough with the predictions for the next round too, though our scrappiness did manage to convince Jerry Crasnick we have a shot:

Ok, enough about baseball! What &#8220;real news&#8221; happened in St. Louis over the weekend? Eh, about the same as always: We can&#8217;t drive and love to shoot each other. Tell &#8217;em KMOV homepage!

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10832" title="2011_10_09_weekend_kmov-1" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/10/2011_10_09_weekend_kmov-1.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="315" />][4]If you just aren&#8217;t feeling in a count kinda mood, that&#8217;s four shootings, three fatal car accidents and one lady that got hearing damage in Pittsburg. Oh and at least one man who&#8217;s job it is to deal with all of this stuff said &#8220;Screw this.&#8221; and left, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/10/10/east-st-louis-police-chief-fires-himself/" target="_blank">but you already knew about that</a>.

That&#8217;s your St. Louis weekend in a nutshell!
