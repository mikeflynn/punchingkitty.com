Hey Boston, where you at? Oh 15.  That&#8217;s cute I guess&#8230;glad you _barely_ made the list&#8230;it&#8217;s probably a &#8220;nice&#8221; size which we both know means its small.  Kansas City! Looking good out there not even ranking in the top 15, its cool though, we hear fat chicks will take just about anything.

Washington DC ranking in at #2 shows that if you get interns to create a vacuum long enough it apparently stays bigger and New Orleans?  We bow (thats bending at the waist, not the knees. Just being clear) to your supremacy&#8230;and we totally know why most of you apparently couldn&#8217;t swim very well.

Figures Chicago would still just barely ace us though.
