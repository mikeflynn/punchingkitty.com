Pop Senario Quiz: You&#8217;re a nice St. Louis girl at the ballgame in your Molina jersey and your matching red shoes, and as you&#8217;re leaving, you see a guy passed out on the street&#8230;who also happens to be a Pirates fan&#8230;who also happens to have pissed himself. What does a nice young lady of St. Louis do?

**A:** Help the gentleman up, and get him to a cab.

**B:** Take his wallet. Pirate fan money buys meth just as well as money from people that like good baseball teams!

**C:** Squat down near his face, like you&#8217;re going to rip ass (or something) on him and give the camera the ole thumbs up sign.

**D:** Take your top off and lick one of your boobs while winking at the camera.

Well D would have been nice, but it was C&#8230;it&#8217;s always C.

Jokes aside, this is a great photo find!
