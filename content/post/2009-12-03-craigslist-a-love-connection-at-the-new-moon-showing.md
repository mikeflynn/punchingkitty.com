> **New Moon midnight showing &#8211; m4w &#8211; 27 (Saint Louis, MO)**

> I sat behind you at the midnight showing of New Moon the other night. Me: 6 foot, dark hair, long nails, mysterious. You: straight long blond hair, full ruby lips, you were wearing black cargo pants and a twilight hoodie. As your hair draped down behind your sear i just had to hold it and smell it deeply(pantene.great choice). I don&#8217;t remember much of the money but I will awlays remember the smell and texture of your hair. The way you sound when you whisper and laugh. After the movie I followed you and your friends to Denny&#8217;s. I waited outside in my car so I could watch you eat and smile. I followed you home and made sure you got there safely. I noticed you left your car unlocked so I went to have a look into your life. I can tell by looking in your car that we have a lot in common. If you want your dash ornaments back you will have to meet me and we can have a great time getting to know each other. &#8220;grin&#8221;

Although I&#8217;m happy he  left out the part about his masturbating back in his mom&#8217;s basement with Pantene spread on his chest and holding your dash accouterments, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the mental picture didn&#8217;t show up.

If you are the blonde girl wearing cargo pants described above, change your locks and buy a gun.  Unless you are in to tall, dark mysterious guys with long fingernails&#8230;and that are probably required by law to notify all new neighbors of his past transgressions, then go for it. Hell you won&#8217;t even have to call him, he&#8217;s standing outside your bedroom window right now!
