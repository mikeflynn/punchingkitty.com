We&#8217;re doing some traveling, and as such, this was meant to be a week off for us, but how do we not say something now?! Here are some quick hits:

&#8211; Ha, ha! You suck Brewers! Talk some shit now!

&#8211; Holy crap!!!!!!!!!!

&#8211; !!!!!!!

&#8211; Love that we won the series in game 6 (even though we missed it while on a plane) since it really sets up the rotation for the Series.

&#8211; !!

&#8211; Well done Tony!
