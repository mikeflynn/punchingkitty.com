We love our readers, so cordial and internet savvy. We also like this guy too, just because we just want to pat him on the head, wipe his face and help him tighten his retard helment&#8217;s chin strap.

> Have you ever bothered to view your site in IE? It looks really, well&#8230;like your [sic] dumb.

We&#8217;re dumb, yet you use Internet Explorer, apparently willingly. Wait&#8230;does your mom know you are on the computer?

Truthfully though, after this email we did notice that our site looks a little jacked in Internet Explorer 8 (versions 6 & 7 are fine), and we will be looking in to that. Usually we would think an email like this would be more like &#8220;Hey I just noticed that the site isn&#8217;t working well in IE8. Just wanted to let you know! Thanks. Also I&#8217;m an Austrian underwear model, so I&#8217;m not good at the internet but I am amazing in other things (I&#8217;m talking about sex). Give me a call some time. My number is \***\***\****. &#8211; Heidi&#8221;

You get more flies with honey than your retard shit you wiped on your wall when you were sad about your friend the balloon not floating as high as yesterday.

Thanks for reading. [_Editor&#8217;s Note &#8211; 6/6 11:48pm: It&#8217;s fixed now according to Adobe&#8217;s Browser Lab. Please email us nicely if that&#8217;s not the case._]
