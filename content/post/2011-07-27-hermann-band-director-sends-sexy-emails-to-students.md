[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10374" title="band_director_holds_boobs" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/07/band_director_holds_boobs.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="122" />][1]Hermann, Missouri&#8217;s high school band director is having a rough week after being accused of sending &#8220;sexually explicit&#8221; emails to a student. Something about blowing his woodwind we&#8217;re guessing.

> Among the charges against 31-year-old Joshua James are furnishing pornography to a minor and “using a child in a sexual performance”.
> 
> The alleged contact took place between James and a 16-year-old female student in the Gasconade County school district, and reportedly involved illicit photos.

High school band director isn&#8217;t exactly a big-time gig or anything, but it still seems like a lot to gamble on hoping the fat girl won&#8217;t tattle on you for sending her dick photos.* Looking back on it now it did seem weird that when he would raise his arms up to hold a note, he would always do a little squeezing motion with his hands.

James has been released on bond and has resigned from his role as director.

* Oh whatever, we both know she&#8217;s probably a little round. Band chicks are like that. (If you&#8217;re not, send a photo. We&#8217;d love to see proof of the contrary.)
