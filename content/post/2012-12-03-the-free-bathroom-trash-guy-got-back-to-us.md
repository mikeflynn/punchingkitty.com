A little over a month ago we sent an inquiry over to the person <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/10/25/free-bathroom-trash-sold-on-craigslist-for-150/" target="_blank">selling &#8220;free bathroom trash&#8221; on our local Craigslist for $150</a>. This weekend, we finally got a response! If you speak retard, please send us a translation.

For context, here&#8217;s our original email:

> We saw your &#8220;free bathroom trash&#8221; ad on Craigslist, and we&#8217;re intrigued. What&#8217;s the run down? Is there a strong demand for your trash so far? You don&#8217;t wipe your ass with 20 dollar bills do you?
> 
> Oh and what&#8217;s the $150 for if it&#8217;s free?
> 
> Thanks!

Here&#8217;s the response:

> Hello,
> 
> Yes. the trash is free! That $20 I am using on my ass is going to cost you $150&#8230;
> 
> Hell, throw in another $50&#8230;and you will get 2 Pussy Pops! Your choice of color and flavor.
> 
> Be sure to ask me about a personal handwritten message&#8230;
> 
> Get back soon,
  
> Robyn C. Riminal

Lovely pseudonym. Also, pasting the email here doesn&#8217;t do it justice as you lose the fact that it was delivered in Comic Sans font&#8230;you know, because otherwise we would have taken it all too seriously.
