Damn dude.  A Million a year for stink.

In addition to the Rams, the following other people or organizations should really watch out because the precedent is now set.

  * 1380AM&#8217;s Kevin Slaten.
  * Anyone by the name of Bruce.
  * People with bluetooth ear pieces.
  * You, if you made more than 3 tweets about the Oscars last night.
  * The Schnucks on South Grand
  * Guys that bring air horns to every event.
  * Dudes with leather jackets and really nice tennis shoes that come ask you for a dollar.
  * The owner of Papa John&#8217;s. (No one cares that  you can throw a football.)
  * People that say &#8220;Fixin'&#8221;
