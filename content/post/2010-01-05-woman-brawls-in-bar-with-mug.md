Seems like every place in Illinois not named Chicago is like one big nasty strip club fight.  Take this classy, might be about to cry or laugh, I&#8217;m not sure, lady on the right here.  She said to herself:

&#8220;Brain, I really want to bash this other broad on the head. But what can I use&#8230;hmm&#8230;what. can. I. use.  What is readily available in a bar that I can use to bludgeon someone&#8230;hello!  Mug!  Ha. Figures, right under my nose!  Well anyway, I got to go try to kill this lovely lady but when I get back brain I&#8217;m going to continue to kill you with cheap beer and meth.&#8221;

That lady was lucky though.  If it was Octoberfest she would have been dead.
