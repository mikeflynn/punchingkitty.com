From [PR 2.0][2]:

> On Monday, the National Football League <a style="color: #0c6395; text-decoration: none;" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10322904-2.html">announced</a> that it will now limit use of social media and networks during the season. Players, coaches, officials, personnel, third-party representatives, and even the media are prohibited from updating their status, blogging, or tweeting 90 minutes before a game until post-game interviews are completed.

Its such an odd thing to mandate.  Sure this is something that makes the more fame-whoring of players to concentrate on the game, but why would the league make this rule?  Wouldn&#8217;t you think if you missed something because you were tweeting, the locker room justice would be far worse than a nasty email from the Commish?

Add to that the fact that this is going to be pretty hard to police and the matter of how you punish a player for this?  Sure, its a fine, but how much is a tweet worth?

This takes a particular hit to the Rams who generally have lots of free time after being down 30 points at the half.
