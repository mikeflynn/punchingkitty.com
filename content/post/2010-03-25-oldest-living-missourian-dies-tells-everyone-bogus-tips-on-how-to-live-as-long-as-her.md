Born on August 24th, 1897, Florence lived on her own until her 90&#8217;s when she moved in with her daughter and then later at the Ratliff Care Center.

> Michael Ratliff, the center&#8217;s administrator, said Poe remained active in her last months. He once asked her the secret to a long life.

&#8230;ok let me pause this right there. I hate when people ask really old people how they got so old because the answer is always&#8230;_always_&#8230;complete crap. You get non-sensical answers ranging from &#8220;I just take it one day at a time.&#8221; to &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell ya. Drink a 6 pack every day, eat steak and eggs for every meal, smoke like a chimney and beat your wife every time she acts up to keep your heart strong.&#8221; and then people just go &#8220;Awww&#8230;you are something else grandpa!&#8221; Seriously, have you ever heard a legit answer from an old person from that question? Answer: No.

Let&#8217;s hear Flo&#8217;s shall we?

> &#8220;She said, &#8216;Well, honey, you just got to keep breathing,'&#8221; he said.

&#8230;and there you go. Completely retarded.  Apparently when you get old enough that people ask you that question you can get away with and dumb-ass answer and people not only take it, they print it like it actually means something. Frankly eating the woman&#8217;s still beating heart to gain her strength probably gives you a better chance to live longer than taking advice like that.
