> A district court judge upheld a ruling that said a St. Louis man could not display a giant mural protesting eminent domain.
> 
> The ruling was a big victory for the St. Louis&#8217; Division of Building and Inspection.
> 
> In March of 2007, Jim Roos painted a mural protesting the city&#8217;s use of eminent domainto obtain 24 properties that provide low-income housing options for St. Louisans.
> 
> Property owner Roos&#8217; mural was visible heading into downtown St. Louis when traveling along I-55, and it prominently featured the words &#8220;End Eminent Domain Abuse.&#8221; Roos was cited within weeks for violating St. Louis&#8217; sign code, having never applied for a permit. When Roos subsequently applied for a permit, his request was denied.

Roos has gone back and forth and plans to go back again by filing a case with the circuit judge.

You know, this is a tough one. Sure this, on first glance, seems like a freedom of speech issue and frankly that&#8217;s what all the hippies are out there crying about right now, but we aren&#8217;t so sure having laws that require someone to register a large sign a bad thing. Sure Roos means well and we support him, but what if someone just wants to paint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tub_girl" target="_blank">tub girl</a> [_Editor&#8217;s Note: That link is to Wikipedia, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the photo directly. You&#8217;re welcome._] on the side of their house? Is that freedom of speech too? Not sure on that one. The real issue here isn&#8217;t whether he should be able to post it without a permit, but rather why the permit wasn&#8217;t allowed&#8230;and they better have a reason better than &#8220;because we disagree with you.&#8221;

To be frank, we love the sign even though we just barely care about eminent domain.  We just think its a cool quirky St. Louis thing.  Though we personally think that maybe if he just put a little more art into it people wouldn&#8217;t hate it so much. Maybe add some flowers or two chicks with big jugs holding the sign up on each side&#8230;and a ninja fighting a pirate in the lower corner.  Which one of them is pro eminent domain? You decide.
