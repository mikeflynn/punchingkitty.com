</p>

> T-shirts promoting the Smith-Cotton High School band&#8217;s fall program have been recalled because of concerns about the shirt&#8217;s evolution theme.
> 
> The light gray shirts feature an image of a monkey progressing through various stages of evolution until eventually becoming a human. Each figure holds a brass instrument that also evolves, illustrating the theme &#8220;Brass Evolutions.&#8221;

The Assistant superintendent said the reason they actually listened to the morons that complained is because &#8220;the school districtis obligated to remain neutral on religion.&#8221; This is the #2 guy in charge of making that area&#8217;s kids smart, and he thinks evolution a religious issue.  Its not.  No, its absolutely not.  Evolution is science, if you disagree with tons of proof, fine, thats your call, you&#8217;re  a dipshit by the way, but thats fine.  However just because you &#8220;disagree&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make it a religious issue.  By that logic, Harry Potter is a religious issue because some retards think kids reading about witches makes jesus cry.

Don&#8217;t forget by the way that this isn&#8217;t even about _teaching_ evolution, but about a joke tshirt that the freaking band had made!

You really suck Sedalia, Missouri.  I&#8217;m sorry if you happen to live there and don&#8217;t suck, and for the kids that want to, and I guess need to, learn about the world without some bullshit filter over it, there&#8217;s always Google.

&#8230;in fact, if you go to Sedalia High School, get a hold of me on the  tip line  or via email (editor[at]punchingkitty[dot]com).  I&#8217;d love to send you guys some shirts with the Punching Kitty logo and the headline to this article on them.
