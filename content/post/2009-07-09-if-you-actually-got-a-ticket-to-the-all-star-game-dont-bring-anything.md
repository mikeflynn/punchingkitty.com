Here are his tweets from earlier today:

> Working on story on stadium/city/etc procedures for ASG week. One thing mentioned: for the game itself, it&#8217;s essentially TSA security. [#][3]
> 
> &#8220;If you can&#8217;t take it on the airplane, you&#8217;re not going to be allowed to bring it in the building that day. &#8221; &#8211; Joe Abernathy, stadium ops. [#][4]
> 
> Won&#8217;t be that strict for the rest of the weekend, just Tuesday night w/the President in attendance. [#][5]
> 
> I do NOT believe that applies to shoe removal. It was not mentioned. [#][6]
> 
> [][6]However, no bottles, even water bottles, on Tuesday night. [#][7]
> 
> [][7]Also &#8211; no re-entry whatsoever on Tuesday night. Not even for smoke breaks. [#][8]
> 
> [][8]They were not shy about admitting that traffic, parking and security will present some headaches. [#][9]

[][9]I would say that sucks, but whatever.  I can pee, smoke, leave, come back, keep my shoes on and take my pants off at home with the HD TV.
