> Police say the woman, 30, got into an argument with a man inside The Eat-Rite Diner at Chouteau Avenue and 7th Street around 5:30 a.m. Sunday. Police say the man left, but returned a short time later with a gun and shot the woman as she stood outside the restaurant.

At least its a quicker way to go then to have your body give up on trying to digest one of their hotdogs marinated in dishwater and cooked up by guy that looks like he used to be a mad scientist&#8217;s sidekick.

Seriously though, killing a broad in the street like that is some cold shit.  Here&#8217;s hoping they find this douche.  I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t take long with this description:

> He is described as a black man age 22 to 24, 6 feet tall, 180 pounds with shoulder length dreadlocks.

Hmm, good luck with that.  They didn&#8217;t mention rippling muscles or eyes so penetrating that they make women fall to their knees and weep, so at least its pretty clear that I didn&#8217;t do it.
