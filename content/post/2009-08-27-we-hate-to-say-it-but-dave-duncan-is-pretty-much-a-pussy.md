Lets quickly recount the ways&#8230;

1. Its one thing to get pissed a little when people rag on your son, its another thing when your son is a major leaguer, and its a whole different thing when your son is a poor major leaguer and is still up here only because he&#8217;s clearly given leeway that other players that _aren&#8217;t_ related to the pitching coach get.

2. To actually dream up conspiracies against your family with your only proof being publications writing poorly about player that is, well, poor is borderline insane.

3. So when you think the whole town has turned against your son, wouldn&#8217;t you appreciate a chance for him to prove himself in a new, non-conspiracy filled town?  Nope, Duncan whined about that too.

4. After that other town (Boston) decided, just like the Cardinals, that Chris Duncan had nothing left worth holding on to, you take a leave of absence from the Cardinals which everyone hopes will be where you come back and say &#8220;Whoops, sorry.  Guess you dude were right.&#8221;  &#8230;nope, you come back and continue to be a dick to the Post Dispatch anyway:

> He repeated a recent stance to not talk for the time being with the Post-Dispatch. He added that his decision was because of some recent articles. In the past he has been frustrated by what he perceived as unfair coverage of his son, former Cardinals outfielder Chris Duncan.
> 
> “I will be at the ballpark tonight, and that’s really all I want to say,” he concluded. [via [STLToday.com][2]]

We love you Dunc, we really do.  You&#8217;ve worked magic here and we truly appreciate that.  However, you are being a bit of a douche about this whole thing and frankly if keep thinking this town is out to get you and your family and drive you out of St. Louis, you might find that eventually it will be true.
