[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9190" title="steven_randall_crook" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/03/steven_randall_crook.jpeg" alt="" width="186" height="264" />][1]File this under &#8220;dumbass&#8221;&#8230;and then sub-file it under &#8220;untrimmed goatee and need of a Flowbee touch up&#8221;: A man was charged on Friday with &#8220;Aggravated Fleeing&#8221; after he hit an Collinsville Police cruiser with his car and then ran&#8230;on foot&#8230;with his car still back there. Perfect plan! Now you&#8217;re busted _and_ sweaty. You&#8217;ll have the last laugh though, don&#8217;t look in to the camera when shooting  your mugshot. Ha! Ruined your photo.

Yes, running was a really really dumb plan. They had your car dude, they were going to find you anyway and now you&#8217;ve got the really manly charge of &#8220;aggravated fleeing&#8221; on your record. Nice of them to at least through &#8220;aggravated&#8221; in there, so you at least sounded pissed off while your were running like a little girl, probably with tears running down  your face whimpering as you tried to catch your breath. They could have just as easily charged you with 1st degree &#8220;being a stupid pussy&#8221; or 2nd degree &#8220;running home to change  his panties&#8221;

The kicker to this whole story is that the guy&#8217;s name is: Steven Randall Crook. Crook! The guy is literally a Crook. Maybe that&#8217;s why he ran, being in his blood and all&#8230;sure, it&#8217;s probably the thing about him being stupid and a big pussy, but it could have also been the name. (No it wasn&#8217;t)
