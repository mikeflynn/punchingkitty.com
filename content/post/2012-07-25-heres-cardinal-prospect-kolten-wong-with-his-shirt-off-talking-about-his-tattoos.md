The Cardinals are looking for anyone that can make them suck less on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s said they are not looking for help at second base. The reason? Kolten Wong (he&#8217;s the shirtless guy above).

Here&#8217;s the Cardinals prospect doing a video for someone about living in Springfield, MO (where the Cardinals AA team is located), his family back home in Hawaii, and something about his tattoos which was clearly a question designed to get him to take off his shirt. Same thing happens to us from time to time. We&#8217;ll just be walking by a elementary school when the lady teachers start yelling &#8220;Hey! Take that shirt off right now!&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll be like &#8220;Ok ladies&#8230;no problem. We&#8217;re walkin&#8217; slow so you have plenty of time to take a peek.&#8221; We knew making this tshirt with an iron-on photo of us washing our balls while staring right in to your soul would be cause a stir, we just didn&#8217;t realize how much the ladies would dig it!

(About 1:38 in, you can clearly hear his teammates notice that Kolten is doing a video with some woman while his shirt is off. The next moments are the woman trying her best to talk over 24 guys loudly cat calling and Kolten trying not to laugh.)

Maybe some people are in to the &#8220;shirtless fit guy who keeps rubbing his tattoos&#8221; look, but we&#8217;re pretty sure that&#8217;s just a fad. Fat guys wearing jorts and a sleeveless tshirt with the arm holes cut so far open it&#8217;s more poncho than shirt is a timeless look that ever goes out of style (in Missouri).
