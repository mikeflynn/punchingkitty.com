Sorry, but we&#8217;re doing some traveling this week and won&#8217;t be able to post regularly, but we&#8217;ll try our best.

Here&#8217;s a sad-looking kitten that perfectly illustrates our feelings about not being able to post as much as we usually do (or do our usual appearance on the John Carney Show), and no doubt your feeling as well since you&#8217;ll be short your usual dose of locally-flavored dick and fart jokes this week:
