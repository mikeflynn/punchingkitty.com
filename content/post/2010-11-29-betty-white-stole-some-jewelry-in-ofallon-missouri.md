First you remind everyone you aren&#8217;t dead and suddenly become the nation&#8217;s &#8220;Random Old Person&#8221; joke appearing on every stupid show that can afford your rider of Metamucil, Blackjack chewing gum and a bowl of only red heart pills. Now, your showing up at Randy&#8217;s Jewelry in O&#8217;Fallon and stealing? Stop it Betty White! Your random appearances are no longer humorous or funny. We&#8217;ll have someone wheel you back in to obscurity with the rest of the old people in a moment.

> A woman set her purse on the display counter and asked for a closer look at several pair of diamond earrings. The clerk pulled out three ramps full, and eventually placed two back inside the showcase.
> 
> The third ramp of diamonds, all $10,000 worth, ended up inside the woman&#8217;s purse.
> 
> The woman distracted the clerk by asking to place a set of earrings on layaway.
> 
> &#8220;She gave us $40 and gave us a fake name,&#8221; said Ryan Hudson.
> 
> &#8230;the name the woman gave for the account was Betty White.

Ok, so maybe this wasn&#8217;t _the_ Betty White. It might be though&#8230;old people do tend to wander off. Meanwhile, the store is offering $1,000 for information leading to the arrest of &#8220;Betty White&#8221;.
