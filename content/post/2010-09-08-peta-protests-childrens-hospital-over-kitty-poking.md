Someone probably put the wrong color lipstick on a test monkey or something&#8230;

> The animal rights organization PETA held a protest today against St. Louis Children&#8217;s Hospital for its use of live cats in a pediatric emergency training course.
> 
> The hospital&#8217;s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Sessions Cole, says the cats are a critical part of the training. &#8220;Even the most sophisticated manikin can&#8217;t really duplicate the anatomy and the reflexes and the movements that are provided by a live animal like a cat.&#8221;

Woah wait&#8230;cats?! Little kitties are being anesthetized and then used as practice dummies for interns to practice intubation on? Dude, not cool. How could you do that to a little kitty? Graphically punching them? Sure&#8230;but not that!

Frankly it would be different if it wasn&#8217;t students working over the cats. If people are going to be rounding up some heavy drugs and finishing by shoving stuff in to their kitty, you should have a professional doing that, like **Paris Hilton**, not some &#8220;trainee&#8221;!

We know how cats feel. Check out our file photo:

Now if you&#8217;ll excuse us, we need to go lay in the sun.
