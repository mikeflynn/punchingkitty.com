As of right now, the price of gas is right around $4 a gallon in St. Louis. Area owners of giant trucks or SUVs are currently torn between hatin&#8217; that dang Obama because of the gas prices, but still loving the fact he killed that dang Osama. Poor fellers, that sure is a lot of of &#8220;danging&#8221; and like-sounding names.

The following things are now no longer driving for because they were barely worth it with gas was only $3 a gallon:

1. Arby&#8217;s

2. Any movie in 3D

3. Pixie sticks

4. Landscaping rock that won&#8217;t end up looking right oh and you didn&#8217;t get enough so you&#8217;d have to go back anyway.

5. The following Vess Soda flavors: cherry, black cherry, pineapple, peach, piña colada, strawberry, blue raspberry, kiwi-strawberry and root beer
