John Cunningham shot Lessie Lowe over an argument about whether what they were cooking were pork steaks or pork chops. Clearly this is a serious matter, so lets settle this right now before anyone else has to die:

> Pork Steaks are cut from the Boston Butt, or Pork Shoulder. Sometimes they are even cut from the fresh ham (hind quarter), but not often. Pork Chops are cut from the Loin and they may be presented boneless or bone-in. Pork Chops are normally more tender than the Pork Steaks.

Also&#8230;

> Are you freaking kidding us? What the hell is wrong with you and why the hell do you give a crap?! Neither are all that good anyway, just make burgers you crazy bastards.

Cunningham said they were about to digest and then later poop out, pork steaks, but Lowe claimed they were pork chops. The argument escalated to the point where they had to be separated, which caused Cunningham to go to where he keeps his shotgun, and use it to kill Lowe.

Pretty odd story, but it gets less odd when you notice when this all happened: 1am. Nothing good comes from cooking non-bacon pork products at 1am.

STLToday sums it up nicely (emphasis ours):

> Lowe died later at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Cunningham, _who was correct about the meat_, was taken into custody.

John Cunningham: St. Louis&#8217; &#8220;Pork Chop Killer&#8221;, er &#8220;Pork Steak Killer&#8221;. Which one was it again? Eh, doesn&#8217;t matter. Both are pretty much the same thing, right John?
