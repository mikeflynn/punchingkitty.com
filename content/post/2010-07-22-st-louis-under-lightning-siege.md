St. Louis is being attacked by lightning! &#8230;Is there some biblical situation going on we aren&#8217;t aware of?

First on Monday, two people were struck by lightning. One person, someone STLToday called a &#8220;seasonal laborer&#8221;, in Forest Park by the Jewel Box and the other Chouteau.

> A seasonal laborer was reportedly struck at the Jewel Box in Forest Park, Capt. Michael Pickett said. The worker was conscious and alert when paramedics arrived but was taken to Barnes-Jewish Hospital for evaluation. Pickett said it appeared to have been a secondary strike that may have hit the ground first.
> 
> [A] man, 54, who was working on a building at 2017 Chouteau Avenue. The man was using a rotary tool that touched a water pipe during a lightning strike, Pickett said.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5735" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/22/st-louis-under-lightning-siege/city_museum_lightning/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5735" title="city_museum_lightning" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/city_museum_lightning.jpg?filter=resize&w=200" alt="" /></a>Just yesterday, we learn of the news that our town&#8217;s beloved City Museum has been damaged by a lightning strike (move  your lookin&#8217; balls right)!

What the hell is going on? Have the St. Louis brass jailed some greek god&#8217;s mortal son? Have we angered the man upstairs in some way?  <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/10/07/classical-music-station-99-1-finds-jesus/" target="_blank">We sacrificed our classical music station for you</a>! What more do you want dammit?!! What&#8217;s that? &#8230;You want another sacrifice? You want the perfect scalp of KSDK&#8217;s Mike Bush? Jesus. Um&#8230;I mean &#8220;dang&#8221;. But God, if you take our Mike Bush who will report the four &#8220;good&#8221; news stories each night? We&#8217;ll make you a deal: KSDK&#8217;s **Leisa Zigman** and KTVI&#8217;s **Charlie Marlow** instead of Bush. You think about it.

Until then, **<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/search?query=Paul+McKee" target="_blank">Paul McKee</a>** told us to tell you that if you level a few buildings by lightning strikes in North City that would be awesome.
