We took some famous St. Louis names and ran them through the Internet Anagram Server to find some random letter mixed-up awesomeness. Here&#8217;s what we got:

**Vandeventer** &#8230; &#8220;Darn Even Vet&#8221;

**Mark McGwire** &#8230; &#8220;Rim Wreck Mag&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: Sounds as sexy as it does gross._]

**Hampton** &#8230; &#8220;Moth Nap&#8221;

**Busch Stadium** &#8230; &#8220;Basic Mud Huts&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: Is this a hidden critique of the Ballpark Village plans?_]

**The Post Dispatch** &#8230; &#8220;Spot Patched Shit&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: Wow._]

**Leisa Zigman** &#8230; &#8220;Amazing Lies&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: This one is true, we swear and it&#8217;s freaking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">awesome</span>!_]

**Homeless Guy Peeing On My Car** &#8230; &#8220;Snug Paisley Homo Emergency&#8221;
