We aren&#8217;t just &#8220;America&#8221; here in St. Louis, we&#8217;re _Middle_ America, the &#8220;Heartland&#8221;, right in the center! If someone would to motorboat lady America&#8217;s giant boobs, their nose would be rubbing St. Louis. As such, we love the Fourth of July and all the crap that comes with it: funnel cakes, tank tops, cut off jean shorts, washed up 90s bands playing loudly, and fireworks. Oh and if you think our patriotism is as fleeting as our love/hate relationship with Cardinal relief pitchers, it&#8217;s not! It doesn&#8217;t wear off with sweat, it doesn&#8217;t fade in the sun&#8230;but it does apparently wash off in the rain.

> &#8220;Due to current weather conditions in the St. Louis metropolitan area, Fair Saint Louis regrets to announce the cancellation of tonight&#8217;s Maroon 5 concert and the US Bank/Enterprise fireworks. All other activities are likewise canceled. We are now focusing on having a great 4th of July celebration with Montgomery Gentry. &#8220;

> Fairgoer, Kayla Weber was disappointed. She says, &#8220;We have been looking forward to this for six months for Maroon 5. And we came all the way out here for this and now they&#8217;re cancelling it, ridiciulous [sic].&#8221;

So all it takes to squash a celebration of freedom is rain. Not that we disagree mind you, nothing makes you hate everything, including your country, more than having soggy feet. You say you can &#8220;walk it off&#8221; or &#8220;eh, it will dry.&#8221; No. No it won&#8217;t. Then you&#8217;ll get home and pull off that nasty wet sock, look at your wrinkled white feet and we&#8217;re willing to be the last thing you want to do is do that loud &#8220;Wooooo!&#8221; thing at Jumbotron with an American flag picture on it.

The saddest part of Sunday&#8217;s rain out wasn&#8217;t the temporary loss of patriotism, but was the concerts that people missed. Sure people like Kayla were bummed about headliners Maroon 5&#8217;s show getting cancelled, but worse yet, local band (and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/26/optioncontrol-and-cheers-bobby-at-ciceros/" target="_blank">friends of the site</a>) **Option//Control** won a vote to make it on stage Sunday, but the rain washed that opportunity away which is a total bummer. Can we bring back those shows?! No, we can&#8217;t. Not really. But we can link to the two bands in the correct order to _simulate_ a concert that was washed down the drain like so much red, white and blue facepaint:

Our first act are here because of their rabid fan base, great songs, putting girls in lingere in the background of their videos and the fact that I see their name when I look at the lower left of my keyboard, lets give it up for Option//Control!

&#8230;are you ready?! We can&#8217;t hear you! We said, are you ready for the next act?! Yeah! They need no introduction! You know who these guys are! Maroon 5!!!!!

(&#8230;singing the Backstreet Boys. This is them right? We thought they had more members than this, but itÂ _does_ sound pretty much the same, so we rolled the dice.)
