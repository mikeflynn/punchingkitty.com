[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9318" title="lawn_darts" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/03/lawn_darts.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="200" />][1]Some guy in Jefferson County sells lawn darts (naturally) online and the feds just shut his ass down! The FBI order of &#8220;dangerousness of stuff&#8221; goes in this order: 1. Movie piracy 2. Child porn 3. Lawn darts 4. Lindsay Lohan 5. Terrorism

> The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in St. Louis filed suit Tuesday to stop a Jefferson County retailer from selling banned lawn darts.
> 
> The civil complaint, which asks a judge to ban future sales of the darts, says that Jefferson County resident Steve King has been selling the darts since at least 2009 from one of his websites, [Lawndartparts.com][2]. In two online stings, undercover investigators from the Consumer Product Safety Commission bought darts twice, the complaint says.

Online stings?! Two online stings?! Questions: Why wasn&#8217;t the first one enough? and Holy crap&#8230;really?

> Lawn darts, or Jarts, have been banned for years after being linked to injuries and deaths of children. King even acknowledged the ban in 2009 on Twitter before writing, &#8220;Check out [http://www.LawnDartParts.com][3] to stock your arsenal!&#8221;

Egads! This lawn dart menace must me stopped! Well he was. His website is now a message about how he doesn&#8217;t/can&#8217;t sell them anymore because they are dangerous.

In a completely unrelated note, Walmart has the following things on sale this week: guns, knives, arrows, other bigger guns, regular darts, slingshots, bats, and guns with knives attached to them.
