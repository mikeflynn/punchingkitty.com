Before the game last night we decided to start up a time lapse shot while we watched the game to capture our joy or sadness&#8230;little did we know it would end up capturing the viewing of the greatest game ever&#8230;ever!

The capture started just before the first pitch until just a few minutes after the game ended, with a picture taken ever 10 seconds. We also have the tweets from our editor, <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>, running down the left side (you&#8217;ll need to be in HD fullscreen to read them though).

<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;">

</div>

We&#8217;re guessing your viewing of the game was probably pretty simliar.
