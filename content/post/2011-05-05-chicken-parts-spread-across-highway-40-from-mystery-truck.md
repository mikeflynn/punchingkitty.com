If you noticed your drive down highway 40 through Chesterfield on Tuesday had a new chicken smell overpowering the usual stink of fast food chains and the ever-present fear of a levy breaking. Though, if you drive past Chick-Fil-A, you may not have noticed.

> Chesterfield Police Lt. Steve Lewis says police are still looking for the truck that dropped a giant load of chicken parts in the eastbound lanes near the Timberlake Manor Parkway exit about 4:30 p.m., forcing a massive cleanup that blocked traffic for hours.

> &#8220;Whoever dropped the chicken stuff did not stop,&#8221; Monarch Fire Protection District Fire Marshal Roger Herin said Tuesday evening. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mess.&#8221;

They considered deep frying the street and allow the area&#8217;s fatties to clean up the mess, offering the street as a Cheesecake Factory appetizer as the portions would be basically the same, but there&#8217;s a good chance they would take the asphalt off the road too and resurfacing would be troublesome since teeth marks are tough to cover up.
