[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7154" title="TeaParty-1_370x278" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/TeaParty-1_370x278.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" width="250" height="188" />][1]&#8220;The Tea Party Coloring Book for Kids&#8221; is described on <a href="http://www.coloringbook.com/" target="_blank">coloringbook.com</a> as:

> The newest, latest and the greatest on Tea Party info for kids that&#8217;s colossal fun and informative! This book is a &#8220;must have&#8221; for children and parents to learn more about The Tea Party. A very pleasant song, coloring and activity book!

&#8230;because having screaming matches in the street with the nutcases from the other side of the political aisle is only half the fun! Bringing your kids, that just want to play and be kids, in to fray is the just as important. If we can&#8217;t mess up our own kids then who will? Terrorists, Muslims or Mexicans that&#8217;s who! We can&#8217;t let that happen. USA USA! Don&#8217;t worry, little Timmy will eventually grow to love his Glenn Beck tattoo.

Examples from the book include:

> &#8220;When taxes are too high, the high tax takes away jobs and freedom,&#8221;

and

> &#8220;In 1773 we had a Tea Party and this led to freedom from high taxes. Today we are having another Tea Party and this will lead to freedom from high taxes again!&#8221;

But before you start to argue with your computer screen none of this is political.

> &#8220;We&#8217;re not really making a political statement,&#8221; he told Hotsheet, noting that his company publishes books on a range of topics, including the Rockettes and Cirque de Soleil. He stressed that the book did not include direct attacks on a political party and contains historical data and information on how a bill becomes a law.

The coloring book has sold &#8220;many thousands&#8221; according to St. Louis-based Really Big Coloring Books Inc. and death threats are being thrown around from the more violently-inclined left leaning folks opposing the views in the children&#8217;s book. Running with this controversy and Fox News coverage, the makers the Tea Party book plan on releasing more in the &#8220;coloring books that are really for crazy adults&#8221; series including: _Paint By Numbers Abortion_, _Connect the Dots of the 9/11 Conspiracy to Obama,_ _The Draw Mohammad Sketch Pad_, and _Circle the Gay Kid Activity Book_
