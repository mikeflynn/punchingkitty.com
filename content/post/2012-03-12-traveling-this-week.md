We wanted to throw a note your way to say that since we&#8217;re doing some traveling this week, posting on the site might be a little less frequent than you&#8217;re used to. We thought about just taking the week off, but we can surely squeeze out a few great nuggest of textual awesome out, so why not?

If you don&#8217;t like this news, we&#8217;re very sorry. Please accept this present from the Foot Clan:
