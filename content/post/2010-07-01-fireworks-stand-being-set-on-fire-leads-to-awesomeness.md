You&#8217;ve thought about it. What would happen if you set a fireworks stand on fire? Apparently a really cool explosion followed by lots of whiney sounds about things like &#8220;public safety&#8221; and &#8220;laws&#8221;.

> Fire Marshal Barry Nuss of the Lincoln County Fire Protection District said the fire in the 1,800-square-foot tent was set shortly before 4 a.m., but he would not say how.

We&#8217;re guessing a match or lighter, but it would be awesome if they lit it from a sparkler.

> Fireworks shot through the middle third of the tent, which melted away, filling the sky with a display visible miles away.

Too bad Troy is so far out there no one saw the awesome explosion other than two deer and a crazy woods-people. In fact, if these kids are smart, they should use the &#8220;If a fireworks stand is lit on fire and no one hears the explosion, does it make a felony?&#8221; defense.

Of course, now the public&#8217;s questions turn to their motivation&#8230;wait what?

&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a specific motivation,&#8221; said Capt. Shayne Duryea of the Lincoln County Sheriff&#8217;s Department. &#8220;According to the statements given by one of the suspects, it was purely random.&#8221;

Hell no it wasn&#8217;t random. It was a fireworks stand&#8230;being lit on fire. A tent full of explosives&#8230;being lit on fire. Explosives that make pretty colors&#8230;being lit on fire. Is that no clear enough? Was it right? No. They shouldn&#8217;t have done that, but I think the motivation is pretty clear.

Another example of something like that is anything in this picture:
