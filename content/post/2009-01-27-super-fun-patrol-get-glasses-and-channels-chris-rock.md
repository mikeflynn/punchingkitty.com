Craig Mayhem of Super Fun Patrol is [complaining about his glasses][1], the doctors, and the job they do in general and in the process he&#8217;s channeling Chris Rock.  

> First of all, anyone who calls themselves a doctor, yet doesn’t fix your medical issue is a LIAR. They give you an appliance that you attach to your body and send you on your way, even though your problem isn’t really fixed.
> 
> “Hey doc, I broke my arm.”
> 
> “Really? Well, here’s a crappy version of an arm that you can attach to your shoulder and you can do arm things with it.”
> 
> “But what about my original arm?”
> 
> “You Lose! GOOD DAY, sir!”
> 
> Sure, there are some eye doctors who can laser your eyes and fix them. I’m not talking about those guys. Besides, the damn laser machine does the fixin’, Jedadiah &#8211; not the doctor.
> 
> You’re all SHAMS! SHAMS, I SAY!

Now watch this (NSFW, but funny stuff&#8230;classic Rock):

 

What does thing mean?  Nothing.  We just saw his post and it reminded us of that bit.
