Man some guys get all the breaks.  She Richard up there?  He somehow broke off a piece of that sexy Donna up there!  Man.  How did he do it?!

It doesn&#8217;t matter though.  Now I have a plan to steal Donna away from him so I make out with her and find out what that crust on the corner of her mouth tastes like.

I don&#8217;t want to give it all away, but it starts with &#8220;Here&#8217;s a dollar&#8230;&#8221;

Apparently these two fought another homeless guy over a dog, which I would have written about but then I realized that homeless people fighting over stuff _isn&#8217;t even remotely newsworthy_!  Way to be Post Dispatch.
