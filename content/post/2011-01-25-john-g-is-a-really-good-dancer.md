&#8220;John G&#8221; is a professional karaoke singer somehow. This is his story we found on YouTube.

He lives in St. Louis so it makes sense.

If you get that dumb-founded hypnotized feeling after watching the video it&#8217;s because of his crazy awesome dance moves&#8230;or because you just realized someone can be considered a &#8220;professional karaoke singer&#8221;.

via the Twilight Zone or something equally f*cked up but actually real.
