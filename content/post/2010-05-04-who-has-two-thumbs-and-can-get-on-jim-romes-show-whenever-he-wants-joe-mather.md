Mather ran up from the Cardinals clubhouse to repeatedly run behind Wainwright who really tried his best to keep his composure.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/i_ZW-p6IvDM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

At the rate shown in the video, if that interview would have gone on a segment longer, there&#8217;s no doubt Mather would have eventually shown his junk to all seven of Jim Rome&#8217;s television viewers.
