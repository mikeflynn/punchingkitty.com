We thought it might be fun, as May draws to a close, to pull up some of the biggest posts from a year ago. So we dug back in to the archives and found some of the favorites from May 2010 when we were all a year younger, slightly more innocent and Joplin, Missouri still existed.

&nbsp;

  1. **05.14.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/14/crown-candy-record-breaker-lied-about-his-identity/" target="_blank">Crown Candy Record Breaker Lied About His Identity</a>&#8221; &#8212; It was one year ago when we broke the story about the Crown Candy Malt Challenge being destroyed by a mystery man. The rest is history!
  2. **05.21.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/21/st-louis-celebrates-harvey-milk-with-kiss-in-local-media-skips-it-to-cover-nothing/" target="_blank">St. Louis Celebrates Harvey Milk With Kiss-In, Local Media Skips it to Cover Nothing</a>&#8221; &#8212; Last year&#8217;s rant on the biais in local media. The only ones that responded was the Riverfront Times.
  3. **05.13.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/13/albert-pujols-has-a-cousin-named-harry/" target="_blank">Albert Pujols Has a Cousin Named Harry</a>&#8221; &#8212; Harry Poo-holes. This one pretty much wrote itself.
  4. **05.03.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/03/ninjas-roam-town-country/" target="_blank">Ninjas Roam Town and Country</a>&#8221; &#8212; When we saw the tip submission about this story we stopped reading about half way through, put our finger to the monitor and whispered &#8220;Shhh&#8230;You had me at &#8216;ninja&#8217;.&#8221;
  5. **05.24.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/24/lost-finally-ends-and-kdnl-gives-us-the-simpsons/" target="_blank">Lost Finally Ends and KDNL Gives Us the Simpsons</a>&#8221; &#8212; We miss you Lost!
  6. **05.11.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/11/kmov-chases-storms-and-annoys-twitter-followers/" target="_blank">KMOV Chases Storms and Annoys Twitter Followers</a>&#8221; &#8212; Just seemed appropriate to include a severe weather post because next year when we do it, the list will be full of them.
  7. **05.27.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/27/lacy-clay-and-russ-carnahan-hate-the-internet/" target="_blank">Lacy Clay and Russ Carnahan Hate the Internet</a>&#8221; &#8212; They may both still hate the internet, but Carnahan&#8217;s gone and Clay just focusing these days on thinking of even dumber ways to name bridges.
  8. **05.25.2010**: &#8220;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/25/top-5-name-suggestions-for-that-dumb-owl/" target="_blank">Top 5 Name Suggestions for that Dumb Owl</a>&#8221; &#8212; We wonder why we never did check to see if they used any of our suggestions. Hmm. It&#8217;s probably because we don&#8217;t care.

If you&#8217;re new here, read up on some of the weird crap that happened in St. Louis last year and if you&#8217;ve been coming here for that long, it&#8217;s a great time to review!
