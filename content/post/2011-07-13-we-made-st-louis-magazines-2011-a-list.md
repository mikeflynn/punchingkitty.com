Check out the July issue of St. Louis Magazine, the one with a Ted Drewes cup on the cover, flip to page 79, give yourself a second to read about John Hamm on the previous page, then look slightly right&#8230;a little more right&#8230;now look up&#8230;check us out yo! A-List! Right there next to Erin Bode, who&#8217;s photo looks like they really cropped tightly, removing the full shoot where we&#8217;re towering over her with our shirt off and rocking some skin-tight cutt-off jeans shorts, as she looks right in to our crotch. Damn shame. Trust us though, that shit&#8217;s for real!

We haven&#8217;t mentioned it yet, and the only reason is because we&#8217;ve been busy, we forget stuff all the time, and we&#8217;re total dicks and don&#8217;t even say thanks to people that think we&#8217;re awesome. Sorry about that St. Louis Magazine! Anyway, their A-List party is going down Thursday night at Maryland Plaza, and it looks like it should be a good time. We&#8217;d love to attend, but we can&#8217;t for various reasons, like how we like to work this sexy mysterious thing (shut up people that know us), oh and we made a promise to ourselves a long time ago: Don&#8217;t attend anything with <a href="http://girlsguidetothegalaxy.com/2011/07/11/behind-the-velvet-rope-of-st-louis-magazines-a-list/" target="_blank">a theme song by Will.I.Am</a>. We&#8217;re sorry, but it&#8217;s a matter of principal and we hope everyone understands.

Also, be sure to check out the much longer interview I did with them a few months back for their website: &#8220;<a href="http://www.stlmag.com/Blogs/Look-Listen/March-2011/Coming-out-Swinging/" target="_blank">Coming Out Swinging: Punching Kitty&#8217;s Mike Flynn</a>&#8220;
