[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913" title="70_protest" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/70_protest.jpg" alt="70_protest" width="585" height="267" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/70_protest.jpg 585w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/70_protest-300x136.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" />][1]The African-American Business and Contractors Association (which I think spells out L.O.N.G.A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.) is upset because they believe there were not enough black contractors hired in the massive highway 70 project, so they planned to &#8220;shut down&#8221; the highway Monday during evening rush hour, which is 10 years to the day to a similar protest.

First let me say this:  If the Aferican-American Business&#8230;(whatever)&#8217;s claims are correct and there was any prejudice at play when the contractors for the Hwy 70 project were picked (or for _any_ job for that matter) then I&#8217;m with them in saying that is f*cked.

Now let me say this: This is the dumbest protest I&#8217;ve ever seen.  [Look at the video below][2], two cars stopped at the same time on 70 during rush hour.  Wow.  Shocking.  I thought protests were supposed to be something crazy that I normally wouldn&#8217;t do to get my attention, like chaining myself to something or standing in front of a tank.  Two cars stopping at the same time on the highway happens about 4 times a day when someone gets in an accident or just some retard stops their car because they saw something shiny.  Also, this is pretty dicky.  You want to picket a building?  Fine, at least you are only bothering the people in the building that you think wronged you.  Backing up traffic during rush-hour when people that did nothing wrong just want to go home?  Dude.  Screw you.

I also love their promise that there is &#8220;much more to come&#8221;  I&#8217;m guessing the next stop in your annoying people that didn&#8217;t do anything campaign, is just going to a mall food court and knocking people&#8217;s drinks out of their hand.  That&#8217;ll teach them.
