[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8171" title="car-theft-lock" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/12/car-theft-lock.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="238" />][1]&#8216;Twas a cold St. Louis night, when all through this dude&#8217;s house not a creature was stirring, not even the homeless guy living in his garage. When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter, dude sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. What&#8217;s this? Two guys stealing my brother&#8217;s car? He tore open the shutters and grabbed his gun! &#8230;and promptly walked on his porch, tripped and shot himself in the leg. The two car thieves grabbed some stuff and took off.

Might be time to invest in a &#8220;Welcome,&#8221; or rather a &#8220;Stop Our I&#8217;ll Shoot&#8221; mat out on the porch.

> At about 4:40 a.m., the man was at home in the 4600 block of Vernon Avenue when he heard noises outside. He looked out and saw three men inside a family member&#8217;s car, which was parked on the street.
> 
> The man grabbed his gun and walked outside. But he slipped on the porch, and the gun went off.
> 
> The man, 51, shot himself in the leg. Police did not provide a condition but said he was stable.

This whole story is pretty much a metaphor for St. Louis. Seeing crime, wanting to stop that crime, but you end up just hurting yourself.

Meanwhile in North St. Louis two car jackers took the time out of their car window smashing gig to do the neighborly thing and just go in and shoot the home owner while he was still in bed. It&#8217;s just rude to make a guy have to get up and shoot himself in the middle fo the night.
