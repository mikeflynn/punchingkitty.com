[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2732" title="rams_fan" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rams_fan.jpg?filter=polaroid&w=200" alt="" />][1]The other day while driving though the city, dodging the commercials on the radio we caught a tidbit on <a href="http://101espn.com" target="_blank">101 ESPN</a> about the Rams. According to Brian Stull, the Rams coach Steve Spangnolo has created the new 2010-2011 season team motto! No one knows what it is yet, and &#8220;Stully&#8221; can&#8217;t wait to find out if it&#8217;s better than last year&#8217;s: &#8220;53 as 1&#8221;

If this is the news Stully is waiting for this Rams offseason, we don&#8217;t have a lot of faith in the new season. Its pretty clear to us that Coach Spags should be spending his time, well coaching! Creating little gimmicky saying that really don&#8217;t mean shit is more our line of work, and if &#8220;53 as 1&#8221; is all Coach could think of last year, its clear this should be _someone_ else&#8217;s job. So we&#8217;re chipping in a helping Spags with a few suggestions of our own.

St. Louis Rams: _Steven Jackson and 52 fans that just got really good seats_.

St. Louis Rams: _AJ Feeley. That&#8217;s it._

St. Louis Rams: _Feel Free to Set Your Nachos in the Empty Seat Next to You_

St. Louis Rams: _Hoosier Free Since that Khan Guy Bought Us_

St. Louis Rams: _Sam Bradford!!!!!!_

St. Louis Rams: _Seriously, One of These Drafts Are Going to Work Out._

St. Louis Rams: _We Can Only Go Up&#8230;or Just Slightly Down_
