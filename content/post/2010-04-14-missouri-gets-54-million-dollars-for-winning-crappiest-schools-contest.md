The Federal government took one look at our schools and kids and said, &#8220;Holy crap. Give them some money. Its like those Sally Struthers commercials but the kids have less flies on their faces.&#8221;

> U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced Monday that Missouri will receive $54 million in federal funding to turn around its lowest-achieving schools, particularly 50 struggling schools in St. Louis and Kansas City.
> 
> These funds are part of the $3.5 billion that will be made available to states this spring from money set aside in the 2009 budget and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

&#8220;The trick is to misspell Missouri, turn all your r&#8217;s the wrong way and submit your application in crayon!&#8221; says some guy  that you won&#8217;t know so I can just make up a name. &#8220;This money is going to really help the process of education. With new bullet-proof vests and access to better copy machines our best and brightest teachers can stay alive and make enough copies of their resumes to find a nice job in St. Charles county.&#8221; continued Slappy Knobslob.
