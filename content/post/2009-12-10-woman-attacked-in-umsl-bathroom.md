Nothing worse than being at a night class and then getting attacked when trying to take a leak.

> Campus police say they are following several leads. They say the attack happened about around 4:20 p.m. Tuesday in the Social Science and Business building.
> 
> School officials maintain UMSL is a very safe campus, although this is the second time this year that a potentially dangerous situation was reported on campus.

Yeah, we hear North St. Louis is a &#8220;very safe&#8221; part of town in general if you disregard all the murders and muggings.

> No cameras are in the Social Science and Business building. According to campus police, a female student was approached in the women&#8217;s bathroom on the first floor of the building.

I agree.  Lets get some cameras in the lady&#8217;s room right away.

Luckily the woman wasn&#8217;t hurt as someone else came in before anything could happen and the perp got away.  He is still at large and is described as a tall african american man wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt.  Well, he shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to track down since that same non-descript guy has been implicated in every single other North St. Louis crime for the last 20 years.

Eventually they just _gotta_ catch that guy.
