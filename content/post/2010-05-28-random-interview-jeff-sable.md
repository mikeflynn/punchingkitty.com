Who better to get it going again than Jeff Sable?

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">Punching Kitty:</span>** Who are you?

> Jeff Sable, I sing songs and play guitar in a band called&#8230;uh..Sable.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: How&#8217;s it going?

> Busy,  I travel a lot and come back on the weekends to play Fast Eddie’s Bon-Air.  I just got asked to be in the big Nashville CMA Fest Parade, so that’s an honor.  Also got a video going out to CMT and GAC in the next few weeks.  I play about 7 shows a week so that’s good too.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: What&#8217;s the craziest thing you&#8217;ve seen at a gig?

> Craziest or most upsetting?  I was playing in Jackson, MS  at bar on the reservoir and 2 girls drove their car under the stage/bar and drowned while I was playing.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Uh. Yeah. We&#8217;ll count that. What&#8217;s the thing about playing at Fast Eddies?

> It’s a great crowd, always having fun, I have been playing there for over 10 years!

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Have you ever thought about buying a ton of the shrimp, putting them all in an inflatable tub and eating your way out of it&#8230;while doing a show?

> I can honestly say No.  It’s never even occurred to me.  Maybe if somebody peeled ‘em.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Well yeah, I would assume they would be pre-peeled. If not, then we&#8217;re with you. We don&#8217;t peel our own inflatable tub shrimp.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Don&#8217;t think about it: Best album ever! Go!

> Stevie Wonder – Songs in the Key of Life

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Think of your own question and then answer it.

> YES.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-4729" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/28/random-interview-jeff-sable/flint-martian/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4729" title="flint martian" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/05/flint-martian.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="82" height="98" /></a>PK</span>**: Clever. If you could fight one celebrity who would it be?

> Hmmmm…   There’s so many and do you mean current or all time?  If it’s current, I think Sara Palin,  cuz it’s an easy win and I want her to go away.  All time, the little martian from the Flintstones.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: We want you to know that you might have just hit the pinnacle with that answer. Seriously. We are retiring that question now.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Which do you prefer: The worst part of the St. Louis winter, or the worst part of St. Louis summer?

> The winter.  Love a good Snow storm.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: Have you ever eaten SPAM? It can&#8217;t be good, do other people eat it? ..I mean they still sell it.

> Haven’t ever, I did ride trail in Minnesota that went right by the SPAM factory, ever heard pigs scream?  The smell wasn’t great either, It’s big in Hawaii though!  I also bought a SPAM sweatshirt.

**<span style="color: #ff99cc;">PK</span>**: We think we&#8217;ve heard pigs scream. One time we were walking past a <a href="http://www.curves.com/" target="_blank">Curves</a> when the power went out. Horrible sound.
