You&#8217;re a little drunk, but you can play it off and control yourself but screw that! You&#8217;re 44 years old and the last thing you want to do is to have this discussion about your drinking again with Mom&#8230;but you know you can&#8217;t avoid it now. The arguing starts and you&#8217;ve been down this road so often you might as well have a script, but tonight&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re not the usual drunk, you&#8217;re &#8220;stabby drunk&#8221; and the fact that this lady squeezed you out of her vag and is only trying to help doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t stab her repeatedly to make her stop. Everyone knows the best way to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem dammit!&#8221; is to stab someone. She might die, and you will probably end up in jail, but come on! She said you have a drinking problem, so what are you going to do? _Not_ stab your mom? No, of course you&#8217;ll stab her, and then you&#8217;ll go have that last beer in the fridge you&#8217;ve had your eye on. Yup, this is going to work out great for everyone!

> A southwestern Illinois woman is jailed on charges that accuse her of stabbing her 74-year-old mother during a dispute over the daughter’s drinking.
> 
> Bethalto Police Detective Sgt. Craig Welch says the women argued about [Jan] Madison’s drinking just before midnight Sunday at their home before Madison attacked the mother with a kitchen knife.
> 
> Welch says the mother’s injuries were significant but not life-threatening. She escaped and got help from neighbors.

Madison is now getting over her hang over in jail on a @200,000 bond after being charged with &#8220;armed violence and aggravated batter to a person older than 60&#8221;, which apparently is a thing.

> Calls to the family’s home Tuesday went unanswered.

Well you know what **KMOX**? They&#8217;ve got some stuff to take care of so maybe they&#8217;re a bit busy figuring out if they should visit jail and then the hospital, or do the hospital first then jail&#8230;oh my god! After that you should swing by Hardee&#8217;s because disfunction really builds up an appetite but it&#8217;s totally rude to eat a &#8220;manly&#8221; burger meal in front of jailed or stabbed people because that&#8217;s rude and the fries would fall out through the stab holes.
