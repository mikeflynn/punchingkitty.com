Alright!  High-five cops!

Awww.  Um&#8230;great.  Way to kill the mood.

Now we are happy folk that see the good in these number, but maybe the cops just think that maybe meth heads were too busy to do the survey those years, or the meth death rates jumped up 60% those 2 years.

Eh, wait.  There&#8217;s also this:

> The number of meth labs and dump sites found in Missouri jumped from 2007 to 2008 after two years of flat numbers. The first six months of 2009 indicate things are getting worse, though still a long way from the dark days in the early 2000s.

Gerald Williams of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#8217;s Department. &#8220;If they&#8217;re still making it, there&#8217;s still demand.&#8221;

Yes.  There clearly is still a demand, and the recent concert featuring the worst band ever Nickelback, [sold out][1].  Are the two related?

Yes.
