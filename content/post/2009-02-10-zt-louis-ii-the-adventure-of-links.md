STLog tried to find out what the deal is with the Cardinals and [tickets to July&#8217;s All-Star Game][1].

> Strohm says that those with Cardinals season tickets will have an opportunity to get seats, but the exact locations of those seats haven&#8217;t been determined. The club will contact season ticket holders in April with more details. 

Want to Remember 1986 live?  [Hal Sparks is coming to the lou][2].

[So is James Taylor][3] and is tickets are pretty expensive for a guy I remember being on Sesame Street.

One last concert note: If you don&#8217;t already have Joel McHale tickets, [you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;][4]!

Todd Jordan [tells you about Goodreads][5].

> Goodreads is more than just a place to chalk up all of the books you’ve read. It’s a place to share, be shared with, and to find out what your friends are reading and recommending.

Lastly, Super Fun Patrol laments [the loss of Aqua Pizza][6].
