Maybe we just over-complicate things. Maybe we just gave people from Illinois too much credit. We don&#8217;t know&#8230;

We just never thought that knocking on people&#8217;s doors and saying &#8220;Hi, can you give me some money? &#8230; Why? I don&#8217;t know something about my car I guess&#8230;Can you just give it to me now? &#8230; Thanks!&#8221; would work. It does apparently. Just follow the people that can&#8217;t drive across the river and ask all the slightly more poor people over there.

> In one of the reports on May 27, a white female knocked on a door on Montclair Avenue, in Brighton, Illinois. The complainant reported the female asked for gas money because her mother was in Barnes Hospital.
> 
> A report of the same activity was taken on June 2, 2010 where a female asked for money from a man in the 1400 block of 4th Street, Cottage Hills, Illinois. The female asked for the money to fix her car.
> 
> On June 3, 2010, another incident was reported about what appears to be the same female approaching a home in the 1300 block of 13th Street, Cottage Hills, Illinois and asked for gas money so she could get back to St. Johns Hospital.
> 
> On June 4, 2010 another incident was reported that the female approached a home in the 2800 block of Union School Road, Alton, Illinois on June 3, 2010. The female asked for money because she just moved into the area and needed help.

Does it make you sounds less like a sucker if you call it a &#8220;scam&#8221;? Maybe a little. The word &#8220;scam&#8221; conjures the idea of elaborate rouses, maybe a costume or two. This however isn&#8217;t a scam. It&#8217;s just someone begging.

If someone comes up to you on the street and says can I have some money, its always for fake crap like &#8220;My car is broken down.&#8221; or &#8220;I need buss fare.&#8221; or &#8220;I need to get my girlfriend I left as collateral back from that coke dealer.&#8221; Since when is this news? If you want to give them money, you just do, not because of the shit they&#8217;re shoveling. You didn&#8217;t get _scammed_, you&#8217;re dumb ass just gave in to a beggar. This can&#8217;t be new to Illinois&#8230;can it?  If this was something we could call a &#8220;scam&#8221; it would make every Metrolink station a Nigerian colony.

Here&#8217;s a tip from your friends at Punching Kitty to the people of Illinois for future reference: Nothing is wrong with this guy&#8217;s car. Please don&#8217;t give him any money.
