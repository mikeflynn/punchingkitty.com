A [recent tweet][1] from St. Louis Mayor, Francis Slay:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1255" title="slay_rams_meeting" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/slay_rams_meeting.png" alt="slay_rams_meeting" width="583" height="246" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/08/slay_rams_meeting.png 583w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/08/slay_rams_meeting-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" />][2]What exactly is he planning here?  He didn&#8217;t say &#8220;BYO torches and pitchforks&#8221; and the city doesn&#8217;t have any money to provide us with some, so I&#8217;m guessing its not the old fashion lynch mob this sounds like it might have been.

Pause for betting time!  What&#8217;s the over/under on worn out #13 Kurt Warner jersey doing a bad job of covering a hairy back at this little get together?

The mayor is right though, local support does matter, but also, having the Rams giving a crap enough to put a team out there that can win a few games would help too.

Anyone planning on heading down there?  Feel like taking some photos for us?  We don&#8217;t have the time to get to all these little things, but we would love to have a Punching Kitty presence!  Hit me up at editor[at]punchingkitty[dot]com
