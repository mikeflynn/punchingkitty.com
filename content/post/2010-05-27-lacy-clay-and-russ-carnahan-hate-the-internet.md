Missouri Representatives Lacy Clay (D) and Russ Carnahan (D) hate the internet&#8230;or at least the old white guy with his hand up their asses is making them say that.

> A slew of House Democrats have [sent a letter][1] to the Federal Communications Commission warning the agency not to go forward with its plan to partially reclassify ISPs as common carriers, a move needed to impose net neutrality rules.
> 
> &#8220;The uncertainty this proposal creates will jeopardize jobs and deter needed investment for years to come,&#8221; wrote Texas Congressman [Gene Green][2] on Monday. &#8220;The significant regulatory impact of reclassifying broadband service is not something that should be taken lightly and should not be done without additional direction from Congress.&#8221;

We have a letter about this as well we are sending to these forward-thinking Democrats&#8230;

> Dear all of you,
> 
> Go to hell you morons.
> 
> &#8211; Punching Kitty

These are the same people that were forced to have kids just so they can get help checking their email and printing out Dilberts, and they are trying to tell the FCC how the internet should work. While they&#8217;re doing that, let us tell you how politics work&#8230;

Lacy Clay: **$40,000**

Russ Carnahan: **$38,000**

That&#8217;s the amounts of money our two fine computer experts congressmen have received from lobbyist that also hate an open internet&#8230;what a total coincidence right? They want to give the internet to the people of Charter or other ISP so that they can do things like charge you by what websites you go to&#8230;think Punching Kitty.com&#8217;s going to make it in to teir-1 next to Google? Um. Doubt it.

The internet is great. Leave it alone. There is nowhere else where one can do the research for a term paper, bail on it and buy the term paper, and then spend the night watching porn and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLBIRfL7iKs" target="_blank">guys getting hit in the balls</a>. If only there was a place where I could go read made up stories about the characters of 90210&#8230;oh wait, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/tv/Beverly_Hills_90210/" target="_self">here it is</a>. Its perfect now.
