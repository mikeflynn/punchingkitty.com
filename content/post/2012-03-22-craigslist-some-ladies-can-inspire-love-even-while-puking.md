We knew love could make you barf, but we didn&#8217;t chucking in the parking lot would do much for igniting new love. St. Louis, you amaze us once again! Well done.

> Hey i saw you at courtesy diner at 3a.m i was wearing a yellow shirt and i was with a friend and well you were drunk i saw you get in a taxi and as you left you stopped the taxi only to blow chunks out the door and i felt like it was very lady like for as drunk as you was we made eye contact during that moment i just wanted to no if you felt anything other than nausea please its killing me to no

It this man&#8217;s world, there&#8217;s no time for punctuation, &#8220;no&#8221; = &#8220;know&#8221;, and catching one a drunk girl&#8217;s glazed over glances while she&#8217;s busy reverse eating her drunken Courtesy Diner meal at 3am is the start of a beautiful relationship.

The problem of course, and the problem inherit with all &#8220;missed connections&#8221;, is how do you know if they are talking about you? There are _two_ Courtesy Diners after all, and there&#8217;s little doubt at least two drunk girls simultaneously barfed in their respective parking lots with the most lady-like of grace. So what do you do if you&#8217;re one of these girls and wants to get a hold of this gentleman? Lucky for you your future husband is a genius who took a picture of the barf so you can use your perfect memory of the night to look back and visually identify your puke pattern!

It&#8217;s not quite a glass slipper, but this splotchy puke stain is going to make someone very very happy for the rest of their life&#8230; especially if he sends that puke to a DNA lab and manages to find out where she lives.
