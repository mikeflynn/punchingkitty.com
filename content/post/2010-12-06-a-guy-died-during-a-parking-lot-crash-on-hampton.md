**Update**: A relative of the deceased (and future fan club member) in the comments, tells us that the family learned today that the man in the accident was shot, which makes this whole thing make a lot more sense. _Thats&#8217;s_ the STL we know!

**Original article:**

You don&#8217;t hear this much. Usually it&#8217;s all fender-benders, door dings or pre-teens car jacking old people, rather than fatal, single-car accidents going down in parking lots. Oh St. Louis, you always know just how to surprise us with a weekend fatality!

> The accident happend around 6:50 a.m. on Sunday morning in the 1400 block of Hampton.  Authorities said 35-year-old Phillip Galczynski Jr. from Herculaneum, Missouri was driving his Chevy S-10 pick-up truck when he crashed into a retaining wall in the rear of a parking lot.

Jesus! Was he really cruising the parking lot that fast, or is this guy Humpty Dumpty?

The police have an &#8220;accident reconstruction&#8221; team on the scene working to figure out what happened, but claim it will take 12 to 16 weeks to get the final results. That&#8217;s way too long. If they aren&#8217;t done by the time we go get up to go pee and get a drink then we don&#8217;t care anymore. Blame _CSI_.
