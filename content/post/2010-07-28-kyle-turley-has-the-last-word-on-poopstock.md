Nothing too bad though, just light hearted jokes.

> [7/24][2] &#8211; Congratulations, you just outted yourself to even your most die-hard fans that you are no more “rock” than Hanna Montana.
> 
> [7/23][3] &#8211; Sounds like Kings of Leon had a serious case of Rock “star” sandy vagina.

Ahem.

What do we know though? Yes Kings of Leon are in fact little bitch-asses. It&#8217;s a fact, but we should have more reason that just us saying so. We need to have some big bad ass guy tell you so you know its true&#8230;Well we know a guy. **Kyle Turley** was a certified bad ass on the football field, currently he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gridironrecords.com/gridnews/another-whiskey-the-video/ " target="_blank">a bad ass on the stage</a>, and a friend-of-the-site. We reached out for a comment on what he thought about this whole situation with Kings of Leon. We were not disappointed.

> &#8220;I guess when you make it to the top, you don&#8217;t have to take it in the mouth anymore [in public]&#8221; &#8211; Kyle Turley

Thanks Kyle. We knew you&#8217;d know just want to say.
