At what point are a bunch of meth labs so close together that they become one really super big meth lab? No one knows, especially the Warrenton Police Department because they&#8217;re saying they found a whopping 30 different meth labs in his Warren County home.

The cops stumbled upon Bryan Lang&#8217;s little meth-apoloza when going to search his house after a warrant had been issued in connection to an ongoing burglary investigation.

> Authorities charged 26-year-old Bryan Lang with one count of manufacturing a controlled substance and one count of possession of a controlled substance. He remains jailed on $30,000 bond.

&#8230;which is a steal if you think of it only as $1,000 per lab!

Clearly a huge selling point for any future meth franchisee is the ease and small amount of capital is takes to get a small business or 30 up and running. It&#8217;s simple really: Steal some stuff for seed money, and then just start mixing random crap together until it&#8217;s so horrible that your brain takes you away to lala land until its out of your system. Sure you&#8217;ve have unsavory characters hanging around and you may even end up dead from the constant use of your own product or catching a shot from the seemingly ever-present gunfire, but people need those cravings squashed and business is good.

Starting a meth lab is truly the drug equivalent of opening a Rally&#8217;s!
