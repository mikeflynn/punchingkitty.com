<a rel="attachment wp-att-23" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/01/14/welcome-to-punchingkittycom/kitty_punched/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-23" title="kitty_punched" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/kitty_punched.gif?filter=full" alt="" width="133" height="140" /></a>We&#8217;ve been running Google ads on here since the site first appeared a year and a half ago, but lets face it, they aren&#8217;t great. Â We aren&#8217;t looking to make a lot, or as it were, any money from the site, but we want the ads to actually be a benefit and add to the Punching Kitty product. These aren&#8217;t doing it.

If you are a local (St. Louis) business and would like to sponsor Punching Kitty, contact us at editor@punchingkitty.com. We&#8217;d love to talk and figure out how we can help each other. Open to anything: contests, banner ads or something else we haven&#8217;t even thought of yet.

Also if we&#8217;ve made fun of you in the past. Our bad. I mean, we&#8217;re totally over it and mature. I think it&#8217;s only fair you give us some money now.
