We took a moment in our busy schedule to take in a ball game last night and were reminded that though St. Louis may be considered baseball&#8217;s &#8220;best&#8221; town, that doesn&#8217;t really mean we know the most about baseball.

Imagine our fortune that we landed on the very game that Aaron Miles makes it back to the Cardinals, fresh from double-A Springfield. Pushing down poor Allen Craig who got to smell the sweet air of the Show just long enough to wonder if it was all just a dream. Sorry Allen. You have upside and we are all just about the imagined greatness of yet another little scrappy white guy in St. Louis. You&#8217;re best bet? Hack 6 inches off yourself, strike out a ton, and play horrible defense&#8230;oh, but run really hard when you do get a walk 4 times a year. We love that.

Yes, he bit a guy that tried to take him hostage while in the minors. Yup, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s a very nice guy. Straight up though: He&#8217;s horrible, and lame on his best day. Please stop cheering him, we all look like assholes when you do that.

Here&#8217;s why: Though we can admit his career batting average of .282 in 7+ seasons of major league experience and some 2500 at-bats isn&#8217;t horrible, it all goes down from there. He only walks a mere 5.4% of the time making his career on base percentage a crappy .322 (when starting with a .288 average). It gets worse when looking at his horrible defense, and those the metrics are murky for that kind of stuff, even the most die-hard Miles fans can recall more than a few botched plays (though they won&#8217;t admit it)&#8230;plus all those plays he didn&#8217;t even come close enough to screw up.

Still not enough to make you realize he&#8217;s wasting a bench spot? How&#8217;s about this stat: If you compare Miles&#8217; career to that of the average player, or what is called the &#8220;replacement&#8221; player&#8230;as in any old dude you can call up, Miles ends up costing us 7.4 runs. That&#8217;s right. Grab any old guy in the majors and put him up there, and he&#8217;ll do 7.4 runs better over a season than spunky little Miles. So at best&#8230;best! He&#8217;s basically a random baseball player&#8230;but a little worse. At least Allen Craig as upside.

This is like Royals fans going apeshit over <a href="http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=217100" target="_blank">Willie Bloomquist</a> coming to bat. Who? Exactly.

_[Editor&#8217;s Note: Love love love that for some reason it appears the Royals chose to have <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/06/02/aaron-miles-isnt-good-at-baseball/willie_bloomquist/" target="_blank">a picture of Bloomquist dropping the ball</a>_ _on his player page.]_
