Found this fun little time-lapse video Sean Trani took while driving in to St. Louis a while back, for your Friday enjoyment as you watch the clock ticking&#8230;ticking&#8230; Can you believe it&#8217;s already 4pm?!

Nah. We&#8217;re joking. It&#8217;s only 2.

If you go poop for an hour it will be 3 when you get out though. Just a thought.
