Let that be a lesson to the rest of you parents! If your weird-looking 30-something kid with beady little eyes starts to get heated when you ask him why he can gain 70 levels in Word of Warcraft in a week, but can&#8217;t get a job at McDonalds, just let him be. At that point, poisoning his morning <a href="http://www.thisiswhyyourefat.com/?p=553684363" target="_blank">Doughnut Pizza</a> might be the safer move.

> The stabbings happened during an argument about 10 a.m. in the 7000 block of Hillsboro-House Springs Road where John Bosler lived with his parents, Gary and Leona Bosler, the sheriff&#8217;s office said.
> 
> That argument turned physical and John Bosler allegedly grabbed a metal pipe and struck Gary Bosler, 69, several times in the head and torso. John Bosler then grabbed a butcher&#8217;s knife from a kitchen drawer and stabbed his father once in the forearm and once in the back, the sheriff&#8217;s office said.

His parents are said to recover from the attack, and, in a way, their kid ended up getting that job with benefits&#8230;assuming getting poked with shivs and penises in jail counts as a benefit. (It does)

Happy ending!
