Don&#8217;t be sad though St. Louis, we have no doubt Kurt will be all over the place sooner rather than later. He&#8217;ll be on Fox Sports or NFL Network chatting it up, or maybe even have his own late-night tent church program!  We&#8217;re hoping at some point he&#8217;ll even end up riding shotgun on Becky Queen of Tile&#8217;s magic carpet.

But the best thing about Warner retiring?  We don&#8217;t have to hear the Hy-Vee stockboy story anymore!
