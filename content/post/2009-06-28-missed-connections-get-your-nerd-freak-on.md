> We&#8217;d love to hang out a little, play some Wii, ride some roller coasters at Six Flags this summer, maybe even go to Archon together in October. We don&#8217;t bite, but we&#8217;ve noticed recently that we&#8217;ve only made a few good friends in the area, and many of them live pretty far away from us. [[source][1]]

      Not sure how this qualifies as a &#8220;Missed Connection&#8221; but I&#8217;m not really complaining since it rare to find something that really needs as little commentary as this to be funny.   Nice easy one to bring me back in to the swing of things.
