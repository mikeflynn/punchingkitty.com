> “Africa can and must handles its own affairs,” [Organizer Zaki Baruti] said, “Stop the bombing and military intervention in Libya and Africa.”
> 
> The group is calling on the United States to honor the wishes of the African Union, which was seeking a peaceful end to the crisis when the U-S led military intervention was unleashed.

&#8220;Um&#8230;sure. Ok&#8230;cool.&#8221; said the random guy that works in the federal building in downtown St. Louis. He told the protesters he&#8217;d write their complaints down and put them in his boss&#8217; suggestion box, but he&#8217;s pretty sure it will lose after everyone hears Ramone&#8217;s idea for &#8220;Taco Tuesdays&#8221;.
