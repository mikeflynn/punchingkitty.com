Found on YouTube, this clip from a 1991 CNN broadcast, with added subtitles, claims that CNN and then reporter, now Fox 2 KTVI reporter and 550AM host, Charles Jaco fake a remote, leading people to believe that they were in some hostile area rather than a soundstage of sorts.

After watching the video, I have to lean towards agreeing this this guy, but really who knows, and more importantly, no one does or should care, but the video is pretty damn funny.  This isn&#8217;t just some Daily Show-esque &#8220;remote,&#8221; they have props (a gas mask and helmet from the set of MASH make an appearance), Jaco is rocking a pretty awesome, yet understated mustache, and there is a montage at the end of behind the scenes-type clips that the author uses as further evidence.

We also get this &#8220;warning&#8221; at the end for us _sheeple_ to wake up!  We&#8217;ll pass on your warning there Neo, but thanks for the funny video.

[Watch the clip after the jump][2], and let us know what you think!  Does this kinda thing actually bother you?
