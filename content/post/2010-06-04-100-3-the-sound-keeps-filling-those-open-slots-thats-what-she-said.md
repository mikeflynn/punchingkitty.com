We now hear that both morning **and the afternoon** shift has been filled at St. Louis&#8217; newest music station, 100.3 The Sound.

So, um&#8230;.there you go. Pretty. Exciting. Stuff.

In a related story, I found that pushing on your eye for 2 minutes produces a little squiggly color line show that is just as good as or better than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845/" target="_blank"><em>NCIS</em></a>.

Oh shit I&#8217;m sorry. I forgot that school is out and we have more young readers throughout the day!

Despite persistent rumors, no major changes have been made at The Sound and apparently they are going to stick with the most generic station name possible. Other options on the table were _100.3 The Station_, _100.3 The Commercials_, and _100.3 Hello? &#8230;Anyone?!_
