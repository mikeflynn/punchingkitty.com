Why can&#8217;t we ever get in the news with a nice, regular looking, non-hoosier for once?! Just once. That&#8217;s all we want. Just once to say to the rest of the nation &#8220;Hey look. I know you think we are back water hicks that live in a place where you make movies about fancy California getting sent here as some sort of punishment that ends of setting them straight, and by and large, that&#8217;s pretty close for the large majority of us, but I think it&#8217;s good for you to know that we aren&#8217;t all like this. Some of us have all our teeth and don&#8217;t just make our summer clothes by cutting off the sleeves and legs of our winter clothes.&#8221;

> Chris Shaw — a 29-year-old tattooed father of three who was raised by his grandparents in rural southern Missouri — came forward Thursday as the winner of the 10th-largest Powerball jackpot ever.
> 
> Shaw said he had just $28.96 in his bank account and recently bought a 1998 Ford Ranger from a friend who agreed to let him pay off the $1,000 price $100 at a time. Now, he said, he no longer has to worry about how he&#8217;ll pay his friend — or his utility bills.

If you were wondering why they felt the need to point out the he was &#8220;tattooed&#8221; we should say that the quote was from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/23/toothless-checkout-clerk-wins-million-powerball-jackpot/?test=faces" target="_blank">Fox News</a>.

> Shaw said he bought the $5 ticket Wednesday at the Break Time convenience store where he works in Marshall, a central Missouri town about 80 miles east of Kansas City. He accepted his ceremonial check at the Missouri Lottery headquarters in Jefferson City wearing a tan and red plaid shirt, a red hat and a huge grin — minus two front teeth he says he lost because he didn&#8217;t take care of them but can now afford to have replaced.

> &#8220;I&#8217;m just a regular guy working paycheck to paycheck &#8230; well not any more,&#8221; he said.

See right there. That&#8217;s the crap we&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re getting a check for gobs of money, you know you are going to be photographed and you show up rocking the stereotypical hoosier uniform! As if that&#8217;s not enough, you have to drop the old &#8220;I&#8217;m just like everyone else!&#8221; line.

No you aren&#8217;t!

Look, we&#8217;re sure Billy Ray here is a really nice guy and sounds like he&#8217;s had a rough go of it, so good for him. Now he&#8217;ll have the opportunity to buy all the rhinestoned leather jackets, gold teeth, triple-wide trailers and some freakishly huge, ungodly truck&#8230;but please don&#8217;t tell people&#8230;the national press at that&#8230;that you are just the average guy!

Right now we&#8217;re sitting in a climate controlled home, we are rocking a full set of original teeth, we aren&#8217;t drunk off Colt 45, and we&#8217;re wearing pants. I&#8217;d like to believe that we are the &#8220;average&#8221; Missourian.

Wait&#8230;also we&#8217;re doing lots and lots of meth right now.  There we go! Now we&#8217;re average.
