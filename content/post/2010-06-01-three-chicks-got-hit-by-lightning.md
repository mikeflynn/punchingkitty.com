&#8220;Hey its storming. Lets go to the park!&#8221;

&#8220;Ow.&#8221;

&#8220;Did we just get hit by lightning?&#8221;

&#8220;I think so.&#8221;

&#8220;We should tell someone.&#8221;

&#8220;Ok. How about a park ranger?&#8221;

&#8220;Sounds good to me.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sit down.&#8221;

> As storms rolled through the area Monday, three females on their way to St. Vincent County Park said they believed theyÂ were struck by lightning while en route.
> 
> The females, ages 22, 18, and 12 approached a park official and said notified the officer of their condition. When paramedics arrived on scene, the females were on the ground.

We didn&#8217;t think it worked that way but ok, sure. Why not?

So far tests looking for any super powers have been negative&#8230;doctors think if the lightning would have killed the girl&#8217;s parents, the chances might have been greater.

In a related story: When you google &#8220;Lightning Girls&#8221; to get an image for a post like this, you get a bunch of photos of the _Tampa Bay Lightning Girls_. Tests looking for any more interest in this story by my penis have all come back positive.
