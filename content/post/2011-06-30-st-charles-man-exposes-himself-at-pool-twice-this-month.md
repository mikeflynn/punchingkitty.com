> The St. Charles County man, 53, pulled down his swimsuit, exposing his buttocks and genitals about 1 p.m. at the park&#8217;s public pool in the 1900 block of Muegge Road, police said. Several other customers, including children and seniors, were using the pool at the time.

We&#8217;ll give him credit for being confident enough to stare a public shrinkage viewing the face and still decide to go through with a plan, but maybe there&#8217;s a better way to go about drying off your winkie dink.

> St. Charles Lt. Mike Akers said Wapelhorst Park staff ordered the man to leave the pool a few weeks ago for similar conduct, but he was not arrested then.

We&#8217;re giving out warnings for first-time dick flashers now? Really&#8230;that&#8217;s where public pools have sunk to? I guy hops out of the water, pulls his worm out and the staff says &#8220;Get outta here you rascal!&#8221; Was no thought given to the idea of calling the cops the first time? (&#8220;Should we call the cops?&#8221; &#8220;Nah, he&#8217;s cool. He definitely won&#8217;t do that again! I used to let him rummage through and sniff the bathing suits some of the kids left behind, but I said one more time and he looses that privilege.&#8221;) Who made that call, the 14 year-old head lifeguard? Man, they sure do run a tight ship over at the Wapelhorst Park pool. You can tell by their &#8220;Pool Rules&#8221; sign:

1. No running

2. No rafts or tubes are allowed in the pool

3. No roughhousing

4. No exposing yourself to everyone twice in a 30 day period.

5. No outside food or drink.
