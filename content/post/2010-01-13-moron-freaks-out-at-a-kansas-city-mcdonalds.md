Alesha McMullen has been charged with Class D felony property damage after freaking out in a Kansas City McDonalds after she was displeased with the service and food she had received.

McMullen threw numerous objects over the counter at employees, knocked over both registers and completely disregarded those &#8220;Wet Floor&#8221; signs.  All the damage came to about $3,000 in total.

Oh, and because I love  you&#8230;there&#8217;s video!



No word yet as to why a related video to this on YouTube concerns Fresh Prince star Alfonso Ribeiro.
