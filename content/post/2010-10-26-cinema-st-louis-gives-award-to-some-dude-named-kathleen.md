[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7523" title="kathleen_turner_3" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/kathleen_turner_3.jpeg?filter=resize&w=275" alt="" />][1]Cinema St. Louis took time last weekend to honor **Kathleen Turner**, the Springfield, Missouri native and currently in town preforming in &#8220;High&#8221; at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, with <a href="http://www.cinemastlouis.org/tribute-kathleen-turner" target="_blank">a lifetime achievement award</a>.

It appears, upon exhaustive research, that the award was for lifetime achievement in &#8220;acting&#8221;, not in &#8220;hitting the wall harder than Princess Diana&#8221; as we originally thought.

Seriously, look at her! Your first instinct is to say &#8220;Pretty decent cover for a tranny.&#8221; but no! Actual woman. Actual woman who used to look like <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/kathleen_turner_hot.jpeg?page=1" target="_blank">this</a>. She kicked in Hollywood&#8217;s door and people were like &#8220;Damn, she can act, and she doesn&#8217;t look like she&#8217;s from middle Missouri at all.&#8221; Her Missouri genetics won though. They usually do.

Clock&#8217;s ticking **Sheryl Crow**.
