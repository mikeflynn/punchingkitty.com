While the Brooklyn, Illinois fire department were called away to an fire-related emergency, the mayor had the firehouse locks changed. All this, a bunch of douche bags in close up black and white bumpers and Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s own prank about banging a bunch of sluts while married to Demi Moore on the next super-f*cked up episode of _Punk&#8217;d_!

> The drama started Thursday evening when the chief says a local commissioner called him saying the mayor changed the locks at the department. The chief says by the time he started looking into the matter, there was a call about a vacant house fire just one block from the firehouse.

It would have been awesome if the fire they were called to take care of was a dumpster fire, and once they put it out they would notice that the dumpster was filled with photos of the mayor giving them the finger. That&#8217;s how we would do it if we were the mayor of a town no one&#8217;s never heard of and decided one day that we hated the fire department so much I felt it necessary to go completely out of my way to screw with them! I would also really stock up on smoke alarms and extinguishers since the guys that have access to the hydrant out front probably won&#8217;t be rushing to help me out when my turkey frying experiment goes south.

> While he was being questioned by police, the mayor admitted changing the locks but claims the building was unlocked Thursday night and a door was wide open.
> 
> Illinois State Police are now investigating, but so far nobody has been arrested.

There&#8217;s a part of us that pauses to say &#8220;Well there&#8217;s two sides to every story!&#8221;, but what the hell could be the other side to this story? &#8220;Well you see I _had_ to lock the Fire Department out of their headquarters because&#8230;because&#8230;I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s where the make the fire&#8230;?&#8221; If we were on that fire department, we&#8217;d sneak in to the Mayor&#8217;s house and lock him out, then go to his mother&#8217;s house and kick her ass, then go _back_ to his house and pee on random stuff, and finally, we&#8217;d use up all his toothpaste. These are just suggestions though as we are not fire fighters for any current municipality. We tried out a while back but they said we were too tough. Story of our life.
