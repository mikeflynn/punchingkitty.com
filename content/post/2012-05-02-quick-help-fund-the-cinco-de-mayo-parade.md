It&#8217;s no secret that one of our favorite things that St. Louis does every year is Cherokee Street&#8217;s Cinco de Mayo festival and the 4 year old parade. The parade is an awesomely random collection of weird costumes, bands, people riding scooters and cute little kids dressed as&#8230;well&#8230;it&#8217;s pretty clear they made their own costume. After that it&#8217;s street tacos and latin bands singing about who the hell knows what while old white ladies dance. It&#8217;s just so weird, and we love it.

In fact we missed it last year while being out of town, so now we are really looking forward to this year&#8217;s parade, but guess what? The thing is _3 days away_ and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stlcamp/cherokee-streets-fourth-annual-peoples-joy-parade-0?ref=card" target="_blank">it&#8217;s Kickstarter campaign</a> isn&#8217;t yet fully funded. We gotta fix that.

Right now it&#8217;s down just over 1,000 dollars, which is a lot, but not collectively so lets throw a little money their way to make this parade happen because even if you can&#8217;t, or don&#8217;t want to go at least this is a pure fun thing in St. Louis rather than yet another rally for Knockout Game victims or something equally depressing.

Here&#8217;s our photo montage from two years ago that hopefully captures the delightful wackiness of the whole thing:
