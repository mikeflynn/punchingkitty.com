<a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/05/lankford.jpg?page=1" rel="attachment wp-att-4477"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4477" title="lankford" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/05/lankford.jpg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" width="250" height="347" /></a>Ray Lankford, the ex-Cardinal outfielder, recently launched his new website all about his time with the Cardinals, his accomplishments and contact info to book him for corporate events and parties.

<a href="http://www.raylankford16.com/" target="_blank">raylankford16.com</a> is chock full of tidbits like,

> Lankford hit more home runs at Busch Stadium (123) than any other player, and finished his career in his home ballpark with a pinch hit home run in his final major league at bat on October 3, 2004 .

He was also traded for Woody Williams to the Padres back in the day&#8230;a trade that worked out great for the Cardinals and&#8230;well&#8230;Ray&#8217;s site is about his time with the Cardinals so I&#8217;m guessing you could figure out how that went.

We&#8217;ll give Ray credit for his tough on himself bio that closes with:

> Lankford became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received zero votes, and will no longer be on the BBWAA ballot.

Ok, so for a not even close Hall of Famer and a guy that was a solid Cardinal in his time, what would you think it would take to book him for your corporate event? [Editor&#8217;s Note: Play along and pretend you didn&#8217;t read the title. Thanks.]

1k? 1.2k? 1.3k? Nope. Try 5. Five thousand dollars to book Ray Lankford for an appearance.

If we&#8217;re going to pay 5 grand for Ray Lankford to come to our party he better be bringing some magic tricks with him, and his first one better be making Willie McGee appear. We&#8217;re getting close to making that worth it, but just to be sure, Ray better also bring ice cream for everyone and at the end of the appearance give me $4,000 dollars. If you can set that up, we&#8217;ll talk.
