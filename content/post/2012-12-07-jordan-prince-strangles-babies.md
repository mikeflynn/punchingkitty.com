Probably just out in St. Charles looking weird and strangling babies because they have the nerve to be all loud when you&#8217;re trying to eat a box of Little Debbie Swiss Rolls. You know how he do!!

> According to reports, Jordan L. Prince, 24, was charged with first-degree endangering the welfare of a child and second-degree murder on Thursday.
> 
> Prince told police he became angry when young girl would not stop crying. He said he choked the child and left her on a couch while the mother slept in another room.
> 
> A while later, Prince checked on the baby girl and reported that she was unresponsive.

So you choked a four-month-old&#8230;and then checked on her &#8220;a while&#8221; later? So first she was too loud, and  then, after choking her, an hour later you thought she was a little too quiet? You just can&#8217;t ever be happy can you Jordan?!

> She was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to Cardinal Glennon Hospital where she died the next day.
> 
> According to results of an autopsy, the infant’s cause of death was asphyxiation.

What a piece of crap. We&#8217;re not sure there&#8217;s a color in the rainbow that this guy could stick on his head to distract us from what he did&#8230;or his face. Seriously, if you&#8217;re going to try and do something for people to look at, this guy shouldn&#8217;t be doing it anywhere near his face. Maybe try holding some really bright colored balloons&#8230;with really long strings. Get those eyeballs focused a little farther away from your actual face or body.
