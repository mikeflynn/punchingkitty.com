From Berger&#8217;s new and extremely hard to read site, <a href="http://www.bergersbeat.com" target="_blank">Bergersbeat.com</a> &#8212;

> **BERGER BANNED!:** Went to visit my old friends in the newsroom at the P-D &#8211; just saying hello, reminiscing, a few smooches and hugs. Three weeks after my innocent visit, I received a letter from the Post banning me from the building! So,. to my old friends there, if you&#8217;d like to visit with me while downtown, I&#8217;ll be in the second booth from the door at the McDonald&#8217;s across the street on Tucker Boulevard. By the way, please bring the stapler I left on my desk&#8230; Guess there goes my chance of being Santa at the P-D&#8217;s Christmas party. (Awww!)

How could they kick out Jerry?!  This sweet old guy pictured above is his precious little headshot.  You bastards at the PD aren&#8217;t satisfied with just firing their writers and high-paid editors, now they are after _past_ employees that can preciously put their head in their hands with one of those &#8220;gay as a tangerine&#8221; twinkle in their eye?!

Bastards.
