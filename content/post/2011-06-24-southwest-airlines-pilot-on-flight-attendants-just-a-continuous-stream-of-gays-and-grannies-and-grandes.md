A Southwest Airlines pilot has been indefinitely suspended after his tirade on the current state of airline flight attendants. The full audio is embedded below and it&#8217;s definitely offensive and NSFW, which is why we posted it on a Friday because, it&#8217;s fun to do wacky stuff on Fridays like wear Hawaiian shirts or go up to that new chick in accounting and throw a few double entendres her direction to see how she handles herself. TGIF, bitches! Sometimes you just gotta grab the mic and transmit some horrible homophobic and misogynistic stuff to anyone with the frequency ya know?

> Pilot: In six months, I went to the bar three times. Once with the granny and the fag, and I wish I hadn&#8217;t gone. At the end, once with two girls, one that was part do-able, but we ended up going to the bar and then to the [inaudible] in St. Louis, and all these two women wanted to do was one wanted to berate her sister and the other one wanted to bitch about her husband.
> 
> Tower: Ok, whoever&#8217;s transmitting, watch what you say.
> 
> Pilot: &#8230;now I&#8217;m back in Houston, which is easily one of the ugliest bases&#8230;I mean it&#8217;s all these fuckin old dudes&#8230;and grannies&#8230;and a handful of cute chicks.

> Tower: &#8230;ok, someone has a stuck mic and is telling everyone about their endeavors and we don&#8217;t need to hear that.
> 
> Another Pilot: Hey Houston! [Blah blah blah pilot stuff] &#8230;and that was not us.

&#8230;ok, that was pretty appalling actually. Probably why most companies dropped &#8220;Slap the secretary&#8217;s ass and call people &#8216;fags&#8217; Fridays&#8221; about 40 years ago&#8230;or three years ago in the South. Look a the bright side, he mentioned St. Louis, but nothing bad about us, and he even called out Houston as being the ugliest, so there&#8217;s something. At least jobless assholes seem to like us and think we&#8217;re pretty, and that&#8217;s all we and every bored high school girl who has daddy issues and a cares about.
