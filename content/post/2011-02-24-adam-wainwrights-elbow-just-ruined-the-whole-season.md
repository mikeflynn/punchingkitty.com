Wednesday morning the world learned of Cardinal ace right-hander, **Adam Wainwright**&#8216;s &#8220;significant&#8221; elbow injury. The Cardinals are f*cked.

> [Cardinals and general manager John] Mozeliak conceded that &#8220;things do not look encouraging&#8221; and called Wainwright&#8217;s condition &#8220;a significant injury.&#8221; Manager Tony La Russa called it &#8220;a huge hit.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult for Adam, really difficult, to go through this,&#8221; La Russa said. &#8220;He&#8217;s really an outstanding person and pro. I think he&#8217;s concerned about not putting in his piece, which is what you expect from him.&#8221;

Poor **Nick Punto**. No one gives a crap about your injury anymore.

Seriously though, this bites. First the Cardinals begin a messy contract fight with Pujols, then Edmonds retires&#8230;if you want to count that as a bad thing&#8230;then Punto gets hurt. Hell, we even had an owner die! Its a sad day in &#8220;baseball heaven&#8221;.

But not in Cincinnati!  Oh it&#8217;s a good time had by all over at the spring headquarters of our wanna-be rivals, the Reds. According to Hall of Fame baseball writer Hal McCoy, some of the Reds were downright giddy at the news of Wainwright&#8217;s elbow! McCoy initally reported that Jonny Gomes came in to the clubhouse jubilantly signing &#8220;Wainwright&#8217;s gone! Wainwright&#8217;s gone!&#8221; though, those comments have now been expunged from <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/cincinnatireds/entries/2011/02/23/reds_on_alert_over_loss_of_wai.html?cxtype=feedbot" target="_blank">McCoy&#8217;s online account</a>. Later on, the tone of the Reds clubhouse was reported as a little more neutral regarding the Cardinal pitcher&#8217;s injury, so who can you believe? Probably somewhere in the middle, since it&#8217;s not like McCoy to just make up things, and we know that Dusty Baker runs the Reds like an absent step father, just brushing off comments like that or <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/10/brandon-phillips-calls-cardinals-little-bitches/" target="_blank">previous ones</a> by <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/11/whos-a-little-bitch-now-asshole-7-notes-for-the-brandon-phillips-hangover/" target="_blank">certified douche</a> **Brandon Phillips** with &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221;. He&#8217;s a great manager though&#8230;destroying pitcher&#8217;s arms and riding Barry Bonds to a World Series is really a tough job.

Hey, if the season&#8217;s already toast and Albert&#8217;s on his way out&#8230;screw it. Light those Reds hitters up on April 22nd! Maybe have Lohse do it so he can earn that contract of his.
