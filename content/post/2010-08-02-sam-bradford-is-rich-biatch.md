A believe the parlance is a &#8220;panty dropping amount&#8221;.

> No. 1 overall draft pick Sam Bradford agreed to a six-year, $78 million contract with the St. Louis Rams Friday night, with $50 million in guaranteed money.
> 
> The Rams and the former Oklahoma quarterback concluded negotiations in time for the first full-squad workout, set for Saturday. The guaranteed money is the highest ever in the NFL.

It can get even better for Bradford since, after incentives, the contract can reach $86 Million.

Though his name is getting to be well-known, most people can&#8217;t recognize a photo of Bradford. Here&#8217;s a hint: If you see a guy around St. Louis reenacting the video below, that&#8217;s him.

You know what we&#8217;d do with that kind of money? _Two chicks at the same time._ We figure a dude with that kinda money could hook that up.
