29 year old Alfred Pierce has been charged with grabbing a Barnes-Jewish Hospital employee and choking her on the February 19th. On February 20th, Pierce was charged with doing the same exact thing, but on a different female employee of Barnes-Jewish. The third woman that works in that department probably took the 21st off.

> A 29-year-old man is charged with two counts of third degree assault after choking two workers on consecutive days at Barnes Jewish.
> 
> Police say the victims do not know Pierce and that he poses “a danger to the victims, the community and others” because of his actions.
> 
> He is still in custody on a $500 cash bond.

Obviously having some guy stroll in and systematically choke out people makes for a tough work environment and Barnes-Jewish Hospital has already released the following statement about the situation:

> The safety of our patients and staff is the utmost priority of Barnes-Jewish Hospital. In two recent incidents, staff members became uncomfortable with the actions of the same hospital visitor. Security and police were summoned.

&#8220;Uncomfortable&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really seem like it covers it. Rarely has anyone managed to cough out an &#8220;Excuse me sir, but your choking me is causing an uncomfortable workplace environment, and if you don&#8217;t stop I&#8217;m going to be forced to tell my supervisor and file the necessary HR paperwork to have you barred from the premises.&#8221; &#8230;usually it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;Holy shit! Get this asshole off of me!&#8221;, but maybe that was hard to convey in the press release. Either way, it&#8217;s not Barnes-Jewish&#8217;s fault right? It&#8217;s not like you can just _look_ at a guy and tell he&#8217;s the strangler-type! There&#8217;s no way that you can take one glance at a guy and think: Yeah, this guys definitely going to try and choke me out, so I should probably just tase his crazy ass right now. It&#8217;s impossible! Sure the second day you probably could have been on the look out for him, but the first day?! No way. People don&#8217;t really have &#8220;crazy eyes&#8221;. That&#8217;s just a saying&#8230;
