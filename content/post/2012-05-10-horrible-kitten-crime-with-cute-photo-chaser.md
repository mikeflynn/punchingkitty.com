KMOX has a story about <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/05/09/bodies-of-dead-kittens-lined-up-in-belleville-park/" target="_blank">multiple kittens that were killed and then lined up</a> in a Belleville, Illinois park:

> [A woman] found the bodies of dead kittens, seven in all,- near some railroad tracks.
> 
> Their bodies were lined up all in a row.
> 
> According to police spokesman Sgt. Don Sax the kittens may have been killed “by an animal”, and were later discovered and lined up by someone, perhaps a child.

WTF. No joke here, not from a site with a kitten logo (even if it did seem to have a rough night). We will offer a difference service though: A horrible mental image chaser.

Here&#8217;s a very focused kitten getting some quick work done before heading off for a nap:

Mind cleansed by cuteness of alive kitten. Enjoy the rest of your day.

Oh and these 10 people that &#8220;like&#8221;ed the story on KMOX can get ass cancer that can only be cured by shoving a hot metal rod up their asses and then when it&#8217;s up there burning the crap of our their butt hole, the doctor should be all like &#8220;Whoops, this other book says there&#8217;s no known cure. Not sure where I got the thick hot piece of metal in your ass thing from.&#8221;
