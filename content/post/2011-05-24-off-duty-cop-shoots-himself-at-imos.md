We haven&#8217;t had **Imo&#8217;s Pizza** in a while, and it sounds pretty good&#8230;not sure if it sounds &#8220;leg shootin&#8217; good&#8221;, but good.

> The unidentified officer had been working in uniform as a security guard at the Schnucks, 3431 Union Boulevard. The St. Louis Police Department had approved him for that second job.
> 
> At about 5:20 p.m. Sunday, he went to an Imo&#8217;s pizza restaurant at 3441 Union Boulevard. He adjusted his weapon and the gun accidentally discharged, police say.

Taking one to the leg at Imo&#8217;s while on a break from your off-duty security job at a Schnucks huh? Your mom was right that you would definitely get shot being a St. Louis City cop, but wrong that it would be all brave and wouldn&#8217;t involve you getting pepperoni grease all over your tie.

Though the wound was serious, the officer has already been released from the hospital.
