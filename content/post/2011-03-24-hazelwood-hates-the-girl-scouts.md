Ok, but it does actually seem like you are trying to give the impression you&#8217;re cracking down on Girl Scouts selling their cookies, Mr. Davidson. You see&#8230;and maybe when we highlight this you&#8217;ll see our side&#8230;see it really started to feel like you were cracking down on Girl Scouts selling their cookies&#8230;when you started to crack down on a couple of Girl Scouts selling their cookies. You know? Remember when you told two girls they couldn&#8217;t sell cookies in the front yard off of a folding table because of zoning laws? Yeah&#8230;that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about right there.

> Abigail, an 8th grader at Hazelwood Middle School, and Caitlin, a freshman at Hazelwood West High School, are members of Girl Scout Troop 570.
> 
> On March 7, [their mother Carolyn] Mills said she received a letter from Hazelwood&#8217;s code enforcement division informing her of a complaint about the cookie stand and warning them that selling products from their home violates city codes.

The city&#8217;s side of the story is that they have been told before that they shouldn&#8217;t be selling cookies from their front yard in past years, but after complaints came in about the increased street traffic and &#8220;barking dogs&#8221;, the city decided to take action, shutting down the stand. The city presumptively followed that up by calling the girls stupid and throwing those little playground rocks at them.

> &#8220;We want people to realize the city of Hazelwood strongly supports the Girl Scouts of America and the ideals it stands for.&#8221;

&#8220;&#8230;just not when people complain.&#8221; Davidson (probably) continued, &#8220;Look, the fact of the matter is that old people vote. They don&#8217;t do much else, but they definitely do that.&#8221;

This Girl Scout stand off is now shedding light on Hazelwood&#8217;s other, lesser known, laws such as &#8220;If 5 or more frisbees are found in a neighbor&#8217;s lawn in the span of no less than 7 days, said neighbor is legally allowed to open a frisbee store on his premises.&#8221;
