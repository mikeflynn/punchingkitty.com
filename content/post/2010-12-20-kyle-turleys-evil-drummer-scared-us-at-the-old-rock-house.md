<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/12/16/the-kyle-turley-band-at-old-rock-house-this-sunday/" target="_blank">As promised</a>, we came to go hang out with former Ram and current friend-of-the-site Kyle Turley at his band&#8217;s show Sunday afternoon at the Old Rock House. Here are the details along with a few photos:

  Yes, Turley&#8217;s is firmly in the &#8220;country&#8221; category, and there are many that would shy away from that genre (us included), but don&#8217;t worry, there is still a strong metal coursing through the set as well as his bandmates. Check out his scary-faced drummer!

That dude is looking for your soul and he is going to eat that shit when he finds it.

  When we weren&#8217;t scared by the dummer, we were having a good time though. If you didn&#8217;t show up, you missed a good show&#8230;oh and that drummer is looking for you.
