That&#8217;s what was on some Kirkwood Middle Schooler&#8217;s shirt the other day, and we can sit down some time over General Mills flavored coffee to discuss the reverse cleverness of that shirt and how it&#8217;s, frankly, a rare shot of honesty to claim that Jesus is scaring you in to doing good things, but that is for another day. Today we&#8217;re talking about how Kirkwood Middle School wouldn&#8217;t let Michelle Ramirez wear that shirt to class. &#8230;because it said &#8220;hell&#8221; right? &#8230;or maybe &#8220;Jesus&#8221;? Not exactly.

> The school&#8217;s dress code policy says this is a slang use of the word &#8220;HELL&#8221; and wants to ban it. &#8220;Outside the school environment, it might be fine.&#8221; Kirkwood School District Community Relations Director Ginger Fletcher said, &#8220;But anything within the school that is inappropriate, vulgar use of language might create a disruption in the school, we&#8217;ll ask the student to modify the garment.&#8221;

To be clear, it&#8217;s not the fact that the shirt says the word &#8220;hell&#8221; that is violating the school&#8217;s rule, it&#8217;s that the shirt is using the slang version of the word &#8220;hell&#8221;. So just to be super clear: &#8220;Jesus, the scares the hell out of you&#8221; is no good..but &#8220;Jesus, this school is worse than hell.&#8221; or &#8220;Jesus can&#8217;t save you from going to hell because you&#8217;re one of those people that thinks wearing little fedoras is a cute look.&#8221; are perfectly acceptable.

> Michelle was taken out of her classes and did her schoolwork elsewhere due to her refusal to change the shirt. Christina [Michelle&#8217;s mother] disagrees with the school&#8217;s view of the meaning of the word in question on the shirt. &#8220;There&#8217;s more emphasis on the word &#8220;HELL&#8221;, yes,&#8221; Chirstina admits, &#8220;but it&#8217;s in all CAPS. It&#8217;s a place. It&#8217;s not&#8230; She&#8217;s not using it as a slang. So if she&#8217;s not using it as a slang, then the shirt should be ok.&#8221;

> &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a slang word because it&#8217;s all capitalized,&#8221; Michelle added, &#8220;and even though the &#8220;Hell&#8221; is a different color, that it still mean the same thing: That he does scare the hell out of you, that you&#8217;re not letting the devil in.&#8221;

You know Fox2, you can feel free to edit down the stammering quotes from your interviewees.

Allow us to settle this&#8230;

**To the school:** You&#8217;re rule is retarded and doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. It&#8217;s gotta be rough being held to rules with no grey area like this because whoever&#8217;s in charge doesn&#8217;t think you can handling making decisions like that based on your own judgment. Johnny can&#8217;t read, but at least he knows when you can and can&#8217;t use the word hell in the public school system! He&#8217;ll be sure to use it correctly when he saying &#8220;Wow, I went through hell yanking off all those dudes to get enough money to buy this meth.&#8221; Feel free to put that on a shirt if you want, it&#8217;s all legal according to the hell usage guidelines!

**To the little broad:** Shut up and don&#8217;t wear the shirt to school anymore. That&#8217;s the rules. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t agree and its not like you got your ass beat for it, so just don&#8217;t wear the shirt. If every rule a kid deemed &#8220;unfair&#8221; got to be haggled over in the media Fox2 wouldn&#8217;t have any time to post a story two days late with far less detail on a national news item already covered better by other people. Also, lets just nip this &#8220;edgy religious kid&#8221; thing in the bud right now: It&#8217;s lame, and one day in college this post is going to come up under a Google search for your name and the guy you like is going to make fun of you. If you want to be religious, that&#8217;s totally cool, but lets not pretend there is such a thing as &#8220;punk jesus&#8221; where you rock shirts that have the word &#8220;hell&#8221; on them in spray paint font and you go hang out with your youth group at various &#8220;praise-fests&#8221; with a bunch of other douche-bags with tats and ear stretching&#8217;s for Jesus. as if somewhere along the way he said, &#8220;I hope kids get to be 13 and decide to look like a bunch of green-haired posers because of me.&#8221; We&#8217;re pretty sure you&#8217;re confusing Jesus with Green Day.
