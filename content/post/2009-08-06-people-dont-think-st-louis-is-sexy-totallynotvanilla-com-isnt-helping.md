> In 1974 Steve began taking pictures for the school newspaper, the year book,  joined the photography club and spent countless evenings in the darkroom developing film and enlarging prints. He won first place in a New York state-wide  photography competition and also received the _New York City Fine Arts Award_ in &#8220;Creative Photography&#8221; at the age of 17.  He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the State University of New York which included a minor in fine arts. Although Steve pursued a successful career in marketing, creative photography has remained a life long passion.

You really need to check out my man&#8217;s work on the site, [TotallyNotVanilla.com][3], because I&#8217;m not posting that stuff here.  Let me just drop you some keywords though: _Snizz_, _ugly_, _pancakes_, _glamor shots from hell_, _preggers_, _eeeww_, _one not bad chick but that might just be because she&#8217;s surrounded by uglies_, _birds for some reason_, oh and _NSFW_
