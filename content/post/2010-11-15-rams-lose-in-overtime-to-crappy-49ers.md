Someone tell the Rams that the games on the road count too. For the second time in as many away games, <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301114025" target="_blank">the Rams let a win slip away</a> in the final seconds as the 49ers beat the Rams in overtime, raising their record to 3-6 while the Rams dropped to 4-5 and out of 1st place in the NFC West.

What the hell happened? Maybe we don&#8217;t have wide receivers worth a damn. Maybe the offensive play calling was, once again, lacking late in the game&#8230;or maybe&#8230;maybe&#8230;we should wear the throw back uniforms all the time. They look much better and James LaurinaitisÂ feels like a badass in them.

Why the hell not, right?
