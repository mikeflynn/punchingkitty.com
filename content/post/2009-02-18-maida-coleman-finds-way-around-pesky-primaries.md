Maida Coleman has submitted her signatures and if they are verified, she will be in the St. Louis Mayoral race as an independent candidate despite her long affiliation with the Democratic Party?  She says its because there is already a Coleman on the ballot in March, but you know she just had a big Christmas card list and a loop-hole in the system. 

> Today, Coleman submitted about 1,000 names, well beyond the 526 required to gain ballot access. 
> 
> She’ll have an open house at her campaign office on Saturday near Soulard as she waits for Democratic opponent in the April 7 election. 
> 
> Interestingly enough, Coleman still considers herself a Democrat and indicated she is supporting former Alderman **Irene J. Smith **in the March 3 primary over incumbent **Mayor Francis Slay**. ** **

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">You know what&#8217;s <em>actually</em> interesting?  That it only takes 526 signatures to run for mayor!  </span>**

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">Get ready St. Louis the next Mayoral election is going to be </span>awesome<span style="font-weight: normal;">!</span>**
