The same one as before. Not one from a time machine, the one from this year, the one that was <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2011/01/jim-edmonds-likely-to-retire.html" target="_blank">about to retire</a> like a week ago.

> It appeared likely that Edmonds would retire last weekend, but the 40-year-old is returning for an 18th season in the major leagues. Eight of those seasons came in St. Louis, where Edmonds hit .285/.393/.555 from 2000-07 and was a key player on the &#8217;06 World Champions.
> 
> Edmonds appeared in just 86 games last year after sitting out the 2009 season, but he can still play. He posted a .276/.342/.504 line for the Reds and Brewers, adding 11 homers and 23 doubles. The eight-time Gold Glove winner played first base and all three outfield positions.

Maybe this is one of those deals where Edmonds just wants a contract to retire as a Cardinal. That move is more rare in baseball but common in the NFL.

It could also just be a &#8220;I&#8217;m old, but screw it.&#8221; Bobby Bonilla move too I guess, but damn that sounds like embarrassment waiting to happen as Colby Rasmus flies by him in the outfield and drops bombs over Jimmy Ballgame&#8217;s frosted locks.

&#8230;or who knows? Maybe he&#8217;ll be ok in a limited role as a lefty bat. He&#8217;s old, so he&#8217;s got that going for him on the new-look Golden Girls outfield. &#8230;oh wait! Maybe Jimmy&#8217;s job will be to lean against Lance Berkman so they can just hold each other up out there in right field.

Seriously though Jim, if you just wanted a free month long Florida vacation, you have just sat through one of those no-pressure time share sales. Way easier than having Tony kick your ass for a month and end up getting beat out for your job by John Jay.
