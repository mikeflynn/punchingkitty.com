We like our cheese pressurized, our lights clappable, and we want a really easy way to report any person we might think is an illegal immigrant on a whim.

Thank the City Council of Lake St. Louis, Missouri who&#8217;s roster is not to be confused with Senator McCarthy&#8217;s pose back in the day, (but we will excuse you if you did) for taking the step to make a system to identify and report illegal immigrants easier. You know, so you can do it without having to get off your pontoon boat.

> The bill was sponsored by Alderman Harry Slyman, who says he was confronted with the issue of illegal immgrants working on a project he was involved in. Slyman, who is known for once running a string of appliance stores, says there was no mechanism to report the issue.

Well finally! I&#8217;ve always wanted a quicker way to get at the poor bastard raking leaves for $0.25 an hour, but you know I was just too damn hard to pick up the phone! Thank you Harry Slyman. You are a truly great American.

Slyman plans to had out small dongles that the Lake St. Louis residents to hook to their magnetic copper bracelet next to your _Medialert_ badge. This way if you see a troubling young punk riding his bike down the street, so someone mowing a law that you don&#8217;t know, you can quickly grab your &#8220;**Mex**-alert&#8221; badge and let the authorities know&#8230;and if you fell in the process, you can have them help you up too.

&#8230;oh wait. That was just the neighbor kid with a tan. Better safe than sorry!
