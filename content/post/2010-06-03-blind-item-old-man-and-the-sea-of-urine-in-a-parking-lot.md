Which old-timer St. Louis sports announcer was spotted deciding it was quicker to just whip it out and **pee in the parking lot**, in broad daylight, instead of heading inside for a real bathroom?

In other news, the above mentioned&#8217;s employer is more pissed _off_ than pissed on about the the performance the deal they signed that included the old parking lot pisser, trying desperately to dump the broadcast contract.

Sounds like both the old man and his employer should be red-faced with these moves that anyone could have told them was a bad idea.

Especially the pissing-in-a-parking-lot thing.

Guesses?
