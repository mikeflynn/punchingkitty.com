Maybe you didn&#8217;t hear, but St. Louis native Mark Buehrle pitched a perfect game the other day.  You might have missed it, no one here talked about it much or mentioned he was from St. Louis.  Anyway, when you do something good, eventually you get to go on Letterman and do the Top 10.

Not a horrible Top 10, but number 2 fell a little flat.

In all seriousness, we love Mark Buehrle and the Buehrle family here.  All of them are really great people.  Congrats Mark!
