Lets talk to him shall we?

**Punching Kitty:**_Are you Pro-Smoking band or are you a dirty smoker that won&#8217;t rest until you blow smoke in every baby&#8217;s face and leave your butts in my food?_

> The old 2-pack-a-day smoker that I used to be would put cigarettes out on your forehead&#8230;I&#8217;m older and wiser now.  I&#8217;m for the ban.  Smoking is a dirty, disgusting habit that is dangerous to anyone around you.  Seriously, it&#8217;s not that hard to go outside for a few minutes and light one up.

**PK**:_How about this weather we&#8217;ve been having?  (This is what Leno does&#8230;I&#8217;m setting him up for a hilarious joke!)_

> I love it&#8230;feels like fall should feel.  I like rain, but it can be so depressing&#8230;I thought we were in Bangladesh there for a minute.

**PK**:_What&#8217;s the biggest thing you&#8217;ve ever had in your mouth?_

> A boob&#8230;a really big boob.  What can I say?  I love the boobies!

**PK**: _Not very gender specific there Terry&#8230;_

**PK**:_Virginia Kerr or April Simpson?_

> Oh wow, April Simpson is so pretty.  And I saw that picture you posted earlier this week&#8230;me-OWWWW!

**PK**:_Name the best street in St. Louis!  Why?_

> The entire length of Grand&#8230;if you really want to see what St. Louis is about&#8211;the good and bad&#8211;start at Hall St. and make your way south to Carondelet Park.  It&#8217;s got everything!

**PK**:_If you and me and 4 other random dudes, one of them being a homeless guy with a festering knee, played the Rams, what do you think the final score would be?_

> 27-10 us.  We could gather the kids in my neighborhood to play them and the kids would win.

**PK**:_If you had to watch one local news broadcast, which would it be: KMOV, KSDK, KTVI/KPLR?_

> Well, I tend to watch KTVI because I watch Judge Judy in the afternoon.

**PK**: _Awesome Terry, and how long have you been a 75 year old Jewish woman?  Nevermind._

**PK**:_You don&#8217;t really watch the local news though right?_

> Sadly, I do occasionally.  And this example is why I shouldn&#8217;t:  I was watching the beginning of KMOV&#8217;s 10pm news last night (Wed.), and Erica Byfield is on at the beginning of the news talking about a problem with identity theft.  And she was getting WAY too excited about the story.  I know it&#8217;s sweeps and all, but calm the hell down!

**PK**:_What&#8217;s the most annoying girl name?_

> Misty&#8230;that&#8217;s straight out of Lemay.  Or Autumn.  I have a friend that has 6 kids, and all of them have &#8220;new age&#8221; names. That&#8217;s cool if you like that sort of thing, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What the hell?!&#8221;

**PK**: _Great answer!_

**PK**: _Make up a question, ask it to yourself, then answer it!_

> If you needed help cleaning up your office files or making things run more smoothly, but you didn&#8217;t want to hire a temp from an agency, what would you do?
> 
> Well, of course I&#8217;d hire Terry Blastenbrei!  That dude is smart, hard-working, efficient, inexpensive&#8230;and boy does he have a great sense of humor!

Terry closed it out with a shameless plug.  We&#8217;d make fun of him for that, but we would have done the same thing.
