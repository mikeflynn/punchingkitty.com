While trying to hunt down a stolen car last Friday, Lincoln County cops stumbled upon a car jacking savant out in Winfield, Missouri. Joseph Walker the 3rd is only 19, but he&#8217;s managed to display his skills in a way very unbecoming of someone who is &#8220;the 3rd&#8221; of anything.

> The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office Patrol Division had been attempting to locate an older model Black GMC Sonoma. The driver of the Sonoma was observed on surveillance camera several days earlier, both at Jack in the Box and Fast Lane in Troy, making purchases with a stolen credit card from one of the vehicles.
> 
> On Friday afternoon Lincoln County Deputy Deputies spotted the vehicle on Ridge Road and made contact with the driver, Walker and two other passengers. The contact led to the arrest of Walker.
> 
> Walker confessed to breaking in to over 160 vehicles over the span of one month.

160 cars in a month or just over 5 per day! That&#8217;s insane. We had no idea there were that many cars in Winfield.

Despite the fact that this all went down in Winfield, Missouri, some 50 miles away, the Mayor&#8217;s office couldn&#8217;t let this PR stand by, releasing a statement saying to the effect: &#8220;Got him! Well done Lincoln County Sheriffs Department, bringing down Joseph Walker the 3rd and ending his crime spree. Clearly this little bastard was also the doing all the car jackings in St. Louis too, so yeah! Who&#8217;s to say he wasn&#8217;t? Got him! We should be good now with the car stuff. Now the city will turn it&#8217;s full attention to the one guy that&#8217;s killing everyone and once we get him, things should be pretty kick ass around here. Slay 2013!&#8221;

One last note about Walker:

> Walker stated he worked alone and implicated no other suspects.

So he&#8217;s covering for friends, or the kid is really really good at stealing from cars. We are no fans of getting our car robed, but, in a weird way&#8230;respect. Enjoy jail.
