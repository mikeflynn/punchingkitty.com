That smiling face you see above belongs to 19-year-old Chtonia Battle. Ms Battle was being charged for the murder of 53-year-old, &#8220;super nice guy&#8221; Benny Hill. Chtonia reportedly drug Hill from the van he was driving to work, stabbed him in the neck and left him to die, bleeding in the street.

Chtonia Battle is the worst kind of person. She shouldn&#8217;t even be counted as a person&#8230;&#8221;Chtonia&#8221; certainly shouldn&#8217;t count as a name, so it&#8217;s really not that much of a stretch. Kinda feel like maybe she was trying to rob Hill for the vowels in his name as she clearly needs at least one.

> Chtonia Battle, 19, of the 1300 block of Belt Avenue, was charged with murder, robbery and two counts of armed criminal action Thursday. Battle was ordered held on $100,000 bail.

Cheers to the STLPD officer who took that mugshot while having the constraint to not kick that stupid tattoo off her face.
