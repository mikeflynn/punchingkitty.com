[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1111" title="mcdonalds-logo" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mcdonalds-logo.jpg" alt="mcdonalds-logo" width="298" height="288" />][1]Gary Hemminghaus, 40 a year old who suffers from Down syndrom, has worked at a Hazelwood McDonalds for 20 years.  20 years.  A McDonald&#8217;s.  20 years.  Yeah, Down syndrom, but still.  2o years!

From the [Post Dispatch][2]:

> &#8220;Gary makes work fun,&#8221; said his boss, Sadie Travis. &#8220;He gets along with everyone, and his attitude really picks you up.&#8221;
> 
> Hemminghaus has Down syndrome, and when he was hired, his job trainer told him he would be a productive worker if he could prepare just one sandwich. Instead he learned how to make all the lunch items.
> 
> &#8220;We need more people like Gary,&#8221; [co-worker Dushaun Chisolm] said. &#8220;He&#8217;s upbeat, and he says hi to everyone.&#8221;

So the guy has Downs, but yet has not only hung in there for 20 years [Editor&#8217;s Note: 20 years!], but has also been a successful employee.  What do you get a guy like that?  Big ass bonus?  Nope.  Promotion of some kind?  Nope.

Try a ride to work and some cake and ice cream.

Dude  works at a McDonald&#8217;s for 20 years and gets the same thing he gets every year on his birthday.

> Gary Hemminghaus usually gets a ride to his job at McDonald&#8217;s in his stepdad&#8217;s pickup truck, but on Monday, he&#8217;ll be taking a limousine.
> 
> Hemminghaus, 40, will be celebrating his 20-year anniversary at the Hazelwood store at 7300 North Lindbergh Boulevard, and he&#8217;ll be the guest of honor at a cake and ice cream party that will be topped off with Hemminghaus autographing photos of himself in his work uniform.

Ok, not the limo, but don&#8217;t give McDonald&#8217;s credit for that one, his family paid for the limo rental.

McDonalds did say that Gary could get anything off the dollar menu for &#8220;just 4 of those big silvery coins!&#8221;&#8230;plus tax.
