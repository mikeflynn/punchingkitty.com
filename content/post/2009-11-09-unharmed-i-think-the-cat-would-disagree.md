Found older KMOV clip on YouTube last night.  It a clip of one of those &#8220;throw away&#8221; stories that all local TV news stations do about stupid things like a squirrel that can water ski or whatever.  This time it was about a monkey in Japan that roamed free and eventually took a cat hostage.

Take a peak (its all over at the 1:00 mark, the rest is just bad editing):



If you missed it, here&#8217;s a freeze frame of the kitten rape:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2231" title="monkey_humps_a_cat" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/monkey_humps_a_cat.jpg" alt="monkey_humps_a_cat" width="600" height="389" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/monkey_humps_a_cat.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/monkey_humps_a_cat-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]

The female anchor there (don&#8217;t recognize her, anyone got her name?) apparently doesn&#8217;t think getting humped by a monkey 10 times your size in the bushes is definition of &#8220;harm&#8221; but we, and we&#8217;re guessing, the cat, would staunchly disagree!  We&#8217;re betting that anchor is fun at parties though.

My second favorite part is Larry Conors, explaining it by saying the monkey &#8220;had never seen a cat before, and just wanted to know what it was.&#8221;  Well Larry, we&#8217;ve never met, but if we do, I&#8217;d prefer and hand shake.
