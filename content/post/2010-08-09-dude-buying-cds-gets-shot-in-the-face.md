Pfffffft. Try telling it to the guy that just got shot in the face trying to buy some CDs on Natural Bridge over the weekend.

> A man told police he was trying to buy CDs when he was shot in the face by the seller Saturday night.
> 
> Police said the 28-year-old man was shot in the 4200 block of Natural Bridge in St. Louis around 11:06 p.m. The suspect then drove off from the scene.
> 
> The victim told police the shooter had a semi automatic gun.

What?! He was shot&#8230;in THE FACE&#8230;with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC gun&#8230;and then told the cops he was trying to buy CDs. Either this is bullshit or the victim here is a F-ing badass.

The local police district released a statement that included &#8220;We&#8217;re still trying to figure out why the victim was out buying CDs. We suspect he either doesn&#8217;t have a computer or doesn&#8217;t know about LimeWire, Gnutella or BitTorrent. The victim is in critical condition and will have to be rehabilitated on the use of mp3&#8217;s and chewing.&#8221;

A benefit concert will be held later this year with all the profits to getting the victim a computer and iPod.
