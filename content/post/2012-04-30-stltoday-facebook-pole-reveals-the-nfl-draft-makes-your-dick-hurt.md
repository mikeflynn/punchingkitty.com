A source sent this screenshot of a STLToday Facebook poll on Friday over the tip line (<a href="/tips" target="_blank">/tips</a> or tips@punchingkitty.com):

According to the source, it didn&#8217;t stay up for long, but still interesting to know that while the majority of the St. Louis sports faithful agree with the Rams&#8217; draftÂ strategy, others wanted a better wide receiver, or it just all simply made their dick hurt.

Factor in failures like this and their constant use of pop up ads, and maybe it makes more sense to just have the Post Dispatch stick to writing stuff on dead trees.
