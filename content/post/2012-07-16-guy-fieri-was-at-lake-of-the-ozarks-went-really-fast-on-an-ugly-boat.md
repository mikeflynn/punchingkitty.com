Food Network star and host of the always on &#8220;Diners Drive-ins and Dives&#8221; Guy Fieri spent at least part of his weekend at Lake of the Ozarks. We know this because of this tweet bragging about his lake activities:

That seems a tad unsafe, but we couldn&#8217;t find a posted day time speed limit or a limit on how stupid your boat is allowed to look, so there you go. However, we highly doubt that Mr. Fieri had his Missouri boating safety card on him&#8230;

> By Law &#8211; Beginning January 1, 2005, every person born after January 1, 1984, [yes, he&#8217;s older than 28, but still] who operates a vessel on Missouri lakes shall possess, on the vessel, a boating safety identification card issued by the Missouri State Water Patrol along with a valid photo I.D

Tsk tsk.

Why he&#8217;s in the Ozarks, we don&#8217;t know, but maybe he&#8217;ll be featuring some Ozark area eateries on his show. If that&#8217;s the case, then it explains his excessive boating trip, because if you can survive eating squirrel stew or whatever it is they serve down there, you can survive anything.
