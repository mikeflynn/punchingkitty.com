Here&#8217;s a few quick notes in the aftermath of Brandon Phillips&#8217; testicles finally dropping. Turns out they were behind his vagina.

**1. If Phillips&#8217; balls finally made an appearance, they went right back up inside after Yadier Molina got in his face.**

**2. Brandon Phillips drives the douchiest car imaginable. Naturally.**

Not more than a few days ago, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Brandon-Phillips-purple-car-would-turn-Prince-g?urn=mlb-259381" target="_blank">Yahoo! Sports dropped this little nugget</a> about how the now famous Brandon Phillips: He drives a big purple expensive douche-mobile!

**3. There is reason to cheer for Phillips.**

<!--more-->Cardinals Diaspora explains why &#8220;

> But Didn’t Brandon Phillips make it easier to root against the Reds? Didn’t he increase the fun in this series? Wasn’t that 7-3 beat down more satisfying? Could you wait until the reporters asked him about this quote after the game? I’d probably thought of Brandon Phillips maybe 4 minutes in my entire life. Now I’m actively rooting against the guy, booing through my TV set at him, hoping he embarrasses himself.

We completely agree. How much more fun is this series with the Reds now?!

**4. Walt Jockety kinda cared about the comments.**

> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t read it. Somebody told me about it. But I don&#8217;t think it was probably in his best interest to do that. You know, it&#8217;s not a smart thing to do. And I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have a chance to sit down and talk about that today. But it&#8217;s just, you know, I don&#8217;t like things like that. It just doesn&#8217;t do any good.&#8221;

**5. Dusty Baker pretended to kinda care.**

> it&#8217;s not as if Reds manager **Dusty Baker** instructed Phillips to shut up.
> 
> If anything, it sounds as if Phillips received a free pass from the Reds.
> 
> &#8220;You&#8217;d prefer they didn&#8217;t&#8221; pop off, Baker said. &#8220;But you can&#8217;t put muzzles on guys. Everybody refers to freedom of speech, then you say what you say and you get in trouble for it. I talked to him about it. I put a little pressure on him to play better personally. The Cardinals have given him a pretty rough time personally.&#8221;

No surprise here. Dusty Baker is freaking horrible. He&#8217;s managed to have a few good years in his career despite himself, and probably solely because of the fact that when he finds a pitcher having a good year, he rides them to a good record, but also right in to the ground. Mark Prior, Kerry Wood&#8230;Mike Leake?

**6. Bronson Arroyo really doesn&#8217;t care and thinks Phillips is like T.O. or Chad Ochocinco.**

Frankly we&#8217;re surprised this pothead can still read let alone come up with a decent thought about a current event.

> &#8220;Brandon is being Brandon,&#8221; Arroyo told the Reds&#8217; media. &#8220;He&#8217;s a mini-version of **T.O.** and **Ochocinco**. He stirs the pot. It&#8217;s just what he does. Brandon thrives on that. You guys in the media thrive on that.&#8221;

The only difference being that those two fellas are talented and good at their chosen sport.

**7. There&#8217;s already a shirt**
