<a href="http://twitter.com/CincinnatiReds/statuses/20724030787" target="_blank">According to the Cincinnati Reds&#8217; Twitter feed</a>, they have just acquired former Cardinal Jim Edmonds.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-6131" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/09/the-reds-are-the-new-cardinals-jim-edmonds-acquired-by-reds/screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-12-30-54-pm/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6131" title="reds get jim edmonds" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-12.30.54-PM.png" alt="" width="570" height="229" /></a>This move continues ex-Cardinal GM Walt Jockety&#8217;s quest to rebuild his old Cardinal team in Cincinnati that currently includes Scott Rolen, Jason Isringhausen, Russ Springer and Miguel Cairo.

We hear a waiver deal possibly involving Fred Bird is next, but until then expect an Edmonds appearance later on in the upcoming series vs the Reds.

Update: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5449338" target="_blank">It&#8217;s on ESPN now too.</a>
