> Today the Square team is focused on bringing immediacy, transparency, and approachability to the world of payments: an inherently social interaction each of us participates in daily. We’re starting with a limited beta and rolling out to everyone in early 2010.

Basically the idea is that any business can take credit cards and swipe them on their phone, while the customer gets greater flexibility and possibly added security.  Its a very cool idea and we at Punching Kitty wish Dorsey well in this latest idea.

We&#8217;ve attached a quick interview and Square demo <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/01/jack-dorsey-square/" target="_blank">from TechCrunch </a>below.
