> Just before we finished filming for the season some crew members found 2 tiny kittens living under the wardrobe trailer at The Office. The Mom cat was no longer around. We trapped the little guys and named them Dunder and Mifflin.

Ok, thats pretty damn cute.

Not only is this cute, but a good lesson.  If you want Jenna Fischer to hung you and let you stay at her house for two weeks, here&#8217;s my new plan:

1. Start looking pathetic. [Editor&#8217;s Note: Check!]

2. Live under the wardrobe trailer on the Office set.

3. ????

4. Profit.
