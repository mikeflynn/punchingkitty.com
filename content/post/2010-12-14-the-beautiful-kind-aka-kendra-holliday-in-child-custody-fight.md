> “I have officially received the lawsuit papers from my ex-husband—he is suing me for full custody of my daughter,” Holliday said today. “The reasons listed in the lawsuit all point to my sexuality. I am shocked and disappointed that my ex would resort to this, as previously he supported my decision to come out. I am contacting lawyers today, and have set up a legal defense fund.”

We&#8217;ve detailed this all before but it&#8217;s been a rough year for Holliday who was <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/04/30/details-on-the-beautiful-kinds-disappearance-start-to-emerge" target="_blank">fired from her job</a> when they discovered her secret &#8220;pastime&#8221;, shut her blog down for a few months, regrouped and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/11/the-beautiful-kind-blog-to-return-may-17th" target="_blank">brought her blog back</a>, quickly <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/07/the-beautiful-kind-the-latest-blogger-to-get-booked" target="_blank">wrote  book</a> and followed up that the transition to <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/12/st-louis-sex-blogger-the-beautiful-kind-bears-all" target="_blank">no longer being anonymous on October&#8217;s &#8220;Coming Out Day&#8221;</a>. Now this.

Sounds like Asshat McExhusband, despite knowing about her blog well before he &#8220;came out&#8221;, smelled blood in the water, or even more likely, had a lawyer talk him up in to taking on a &#8220;winnable&#8221; case. Hopefully that won&#8217;t be the outcome. You know what we would do? Bang the judge and then hold on to all those photos of him in a ball gag, tutu and leather chaps&#8230;you know, for safe keeping.

Holliday is asking for donations to her legal defense fund, which can be made via [The Sexual Freedom and Legal Defense Fund][2]{#ArtLink_126177_c7051e}. (Enter the name “Kendra Holliday” in the special instructions box after clicking on the Donate button.)
