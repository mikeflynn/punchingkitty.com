If you&#8217;ve heard of it, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re excited and if you&#8217;ve never heard of it, this bearded gentleman on the right riding a big wheel should get you sufficiently up to speed.

> The **Urban Assault Ride™** is a truly unique cycling event&#8230;and quickly becoming one of the biggest in country! Here&#8217;s how it works: You and your teammate will set out on a city-wide quest for &#8216;checkpoints&#8217; on your favorite two-wheeled steeds.  At each checkpoint, you&#8217;ll drop your bikes and complete a funky/adventurous obstacle course, then remount your bikes and hit the streets for more.
> 
> The goal is to complete all the checkpoints in the shortest amount of time.

At the finish line is a beer garden, in case you needed any more motivation to go along with that pride you tell people you have but deep inside you know its just about beer.

This years course starts in Forest Park and heads through checkpoints at: Big Shark bicycles on Delmar, Mesa Cycles on Big Bend, BicycleWORKS on Shenandoah, REI on Brentwood and the City Museum. Apparently there are also two &#8220;mystery&#8221; checkpoints. I heard one of them is at your mom&#8217;s house. Zing!!!
