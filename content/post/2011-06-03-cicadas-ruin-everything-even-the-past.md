They are the political talk show hosts of the insect world, going on and on all the time, making any kind of rational conversation nearly impossible. When even the crunchiest of hippie pause for a second before saying &#8220;Yes, all live is precious!&#8221; that&#8217;s called the Cicada Pause. No one likes these little bastards. Worse yet, every home movie you make during a St. Louis summer is tarnished by a cicada soundtrack, which got us wondering what some of the all-time great moments in American history would have sounded like if they happened during the current cicada cocktail party we all have going in our backyards.
