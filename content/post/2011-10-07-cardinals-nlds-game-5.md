### Live In-Game Updates:

**7:15pm:** So the game is on what channel? TNT? Can&#8217;t tell if this is it or if this is _Law & Order: MLB SVU_

**7:30pm:** Crap! We forgot to include <a href="http://twitter.com/bjrains" target="_blank">Fox Sports Midwest reporter BJ Rains</a> on our Twitter list&#8230;oh wait&#8230;no we didn&#8217;t.

**Mid-1st Inning:** The Brewers just won. Nyjer Morgan is already fighting someone with a champagne bottle.

&#8230;adding **Bernie Miklasz** to the live tweet brigade!

**8:00pm:** Carp looks sharp. Back to TBS.

**End of the 2nd:** Cardinals up by a run. TLR probably considering taking Freese out of the game because who would see that coming?!

**Bottom 3rd:** Jon Jay is in, Skip out. Probably because they want Jay to do that &#8220;we&#8217;re #1&#8221; slide again when we win.

**8:31pm:** No, he&#8217;s not pointing at a damn squirrel. Seriously, that&#8217;s enough with the squirrel.

**Mid 5th:** Seriously ==> <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeflynn_/status/122488129058902017" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/mikeflynn_/status/122488129058902017</a>

**Bottom 5th:** Quick half inning. It sure would be nice to have more than one run.

**Bottom 6th:** This is a huge inning for Carpenter and the Cards. Please god do ok.

**9:13pm:** You don&#8217;t steal on Molina.

**Top 7th:** Damn, Holliday almost got an extra run for us there, which would have meant I could ever so slightly unclench my butthole. Oh well.

**9:20pm:** Freese out after getting a base hit. We aren&#8217;t joking this time.

**Mid 7th:** Starting to freak out now. Still 1 &#8211; 0, Cardinals, but&#8230;we don&#8217;t know&#8230;just freaking out.

**Top 8th:** No change it game. Changed our pants 3 times so far though.

**9:37pm:** Carp making plays with the bat and his feet! Men at 1st and 2nd! Please score&#8230;please score&#8230;please score&#8230;

**Mid 8th:** F*ck. Bases loaded, no runs.

**9:50pm:** Frucal is a god. Molina continues to frustrate me this series.

**Top 9th:** We&#8217;re freaking the hell out with the stress&#8230;that waitress on that Ray Romano commercial is really hot.

**9:57pm:** Our stomach might be trying to chew it&#8217;s way out of our body. It feels like it&#8217;s getting close.

**Mid 9th:** Shut the hell up Big Bang Theory commercial! Other shit is going on right now!

**Bottom 9th:** Carp still out there, Utley hits the hell out of one&#8230;change of pants #4.

**Game Over:** CARDINALS WIN! Philly in 3 huh?

**10:09pm:** Bring it on Brewers.

It&#8217;s all over! Thanks for hanging with us! This was quite possibly the greatest NLDS ever and not just because the Cardinals won. Amazingly tense series all the way through.
