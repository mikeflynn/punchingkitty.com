It&#8217;s true! As reported by Deadspin yesterday, Elaine LaRussa, wife of former Cardinal skipper Tony LaRussa, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5974170/tony-la-russas-wife-is-a-huge-metalhead-because-of-course-she-is" target="_blank">is a huge metal head</a>. This is so awesome we might cry.

Deadspin retold the tail from Robb Flynn, the lead singer of metal band Machine Head, where Elaine accosted him in a Whole Foods:

> Flash back to about a year and a half ago&#8230; I&#8217;m walking through Whole Foods in Walnut Creek talking on the phone to my friend Tom when a lady and her daughter approach me wide-eyed. &#8220;Are you fucking Robb Flynn?!&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;I could be&#8230;&#8221; They scream with delight and make a big ol&#8217; to-do, &#8220;oh my god, we&#8217;re huge fans, I love ‘The Blackening&#8217;, I&#8217;m Tony La Russa&#8217;s wife!&#8221; I&#8217;m tripped out, they&#8217;re both super nice, we take pictures, my friend is laughing his ass off, more about the fact that I was swarmed in a freakin&#8217; Whole Foods than anything else.

They even met with Flynn (and the band) again in a concert in San Francisco:

> So, last February we headline The Warfield in San Francisco, and after the show, who walks in but Elaine, Devon and Tony La Russa. A bunch of my Chicago buddies are there and lose their minds, and hilariously begin sneakin&#8217; pictures with him while he&#8217;s talking to someone else by &#8220;leaning in&#8221; and snapping a quick pic (which became the legend known as &#8220;The La Russa Lean&#8221;).

Oh and here&#8217;s the classic &#8220;way too in to his craft&#8221; Tony LaRussa part:

> Tony L blows my mind when he tells me that I &#8220;have so much charisma, he wishes he could bottle it and make his players drink it&#8221;.

We can just imagine Tony telling that to spunky little Aaron Miles on a bad day (which was most of his days):

Tony: &#8220;Aaron, you know you what you need? You need to go to meet Robb Flynn of Machine Head and drink his charisma. San Francisco is a good spot to do that in.&#8221;

Aaron: &#8220;Anything for you Tony!&#8221;
