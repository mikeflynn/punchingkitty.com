&#8220;Civic Leader&#8221; Jim Cloar of the Downtown St. Louis Partnership says that about 600 new people moved to downtown St. Louis over the last year.

Hmm, ok.  So it seems like thats an easy statement to just throw out there especially when you clearly have a vested interest in downtown sucking less.  I mean maybe its true&#8230;but its hard to believe a guy coming from his place.  Well look, maybe he just said it quietly to a reporter or something&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t making a big deal out of it.  That would really be odd if the guy was basically bragging&#8230;I mean how could you believe that?

> Cloar made the remarks last week at the opening of Lindenwood University&#8217;s satellite campus downtown.

Oh.  Uh&#8230;ok.  Hmm.
