The people at [Travel + Leisure][2] have rated St. Louis a great place to travel too&#8230;because its cheap&#8230;making St. Louis the Six Flags as opposed to something like Chicago&#8217;s Disney World.

Seriously though, we&#8217;ll take it.  We aren&#8217;t used to getting on &#8220;good&#8221; lists.  I kinda feel like that fat, weird girl finally getting asked out by a football player in high school!

Here are some other rankings:

**Most attractive**: Miami
  
**Friendliest**: Nashville
  
**Smartest**: Minneapolis/St. Paul
  
**Stylish**: New York
  
**Cleanest**: Minneapolis/St. Paul
  
**Environmentally Friendly** (biggest hippies): Portland
  
**Best Singles Scene:** New Orleans

oh and&#8230;

**_Worst_ Shopping**: St. Louis
  
**_Least_ Stylish**: St. Louis

Ah.  That&#8217;s more like it.  Cue the cow&#8217;s blood.
