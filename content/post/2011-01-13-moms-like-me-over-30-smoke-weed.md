KSDK&#8217;s MomsLikeMe.com loves them some polls, and for the first time, it&#8217;s an interesting one: Do you smoke weed? Ah, of course, the majority don&#8217;t&#8230;but not quite the majority one might assume.

Over 30% are toking it after putting junior on the buss! &#8230;well we hope they wait that long. We fear that some may not. Don&#8217;t want to point any fingers here, but the mom two driveways down. You know. Crazier than normal morning hair&#8230;the only one on the street polishing off a bag of Funions at 7:15am? Yeah. Her.
