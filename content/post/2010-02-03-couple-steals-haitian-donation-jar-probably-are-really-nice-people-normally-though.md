Can you believe this?  I mean how sick do you have to be?!  I&#8217;m not usually one to be lost for words, but I really don&#8217;t have anything good to say about this.  I honestly want to be sick right now and I managed to get through all of <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2006/09/27/screech-sex-tape-preview/" target="_blank">Screech&#8217;s porno</a> while eating a sandwich.  And this other time I stared at <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/tara-reid-belly.jpeg" target="_blank">Tara Reid&#8217;s stomach</a> for like 30 seconds without blinking.  Totally gross, but nothing is worse than this.

Who the hell would choose to eat at a Culvers?!
