Take a look at <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2013/01/old_mo_dl.jpg" target="_blank">your drivers license</a>&#8230;yuck! So horrible. Time for a new design! Something a little uglier, harder to forge yet easier to steal, and with the Arch on it&#8230;you know important changes to us, the average citizen.

> The license will have a new look and new security features including laser perforations and special printing that reacts to UV lights as well as overlapping data onto a ghost image in the lower right corner of the license.

> Missouri is also introducing a new vertical license for drivers under the age of 21.

Good, because actually looking at a date and doing basic math to figure out if you&#8217;re younger than 21 is way way too much work. Do we look like a math professor?! Just take your Smirnoff Ice and go little girl.

> The changes not only affect the licenses, but the process for receiving a new one. Drivers will now no longer be able to pick their license up at the license office. Residents will leave the office with a temporary driver license.

Wait, what?

> Seven to 10 days later, drivers will receive their new license in an unmarked envelope.

Because unmarked envelopes don&#8217;t at all stick out amongst the rest of your fully &#8220;marked&#8221; mail. For a city population that has trouble keeping the little license plate stickers for longer than two weeks, or a package on their doorstep for longer than two hours, mailing us our official government identification sounds like a great idea.

So to sum up: This all sounds pretty dumb, and while they claim the change isn&#8217;t costing the tax payers a dime, that&#8217;s just as hard to believe as the changes of these changes actually fixing anything. There is one good thing though, the state is finally clearly marking certain citizens as &#8220;Bro&#8221;s and thus making them easily identifiable to everyone and harder for them to hide by putting on a jacket so you can&#8217;t see their popped polo shirt collar. Yes, it might also just mean his eye color is &#8220;BROwn&#8221;, but that would be stupid since everyone know the brown abbreviation is &#8220;brn&#8221;&#8230;and also look at that guy up there? The guy with frosted bangs pushed up to make one of those little hair walls, like he&#8217;s worried that his forehead zits might try to march on the rest of his head? Totally a bro.
