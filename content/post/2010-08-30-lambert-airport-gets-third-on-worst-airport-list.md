#2 Los Angeles

**#3 St. Louis**

#4 Washington D.C.

#5 Boston

Those are the five _worst_ airports in these United States, as voted on by the readers of &#8220;Travel and Leisure&#8221;.  Hey, at least its not about crime this time!

> Maybe folks just miss TWA: its old home, Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, is dreary to AFC readers on a number of fronts. It ranks last for its airline clubs—you’ll find only one American Admirals Club—and its food and shopping rank 28th and 29th, respectively. Plus, you’ll pay $8 for WiFi.

Can&#8217;t argue with most of that. The food does indeed suck and any airport that charges for WiFi access should be taken out back and shot, and we know all too well about the craptasticness of the shopping at Lambert (<a rel="bookmark" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/27/joesportsfan-figures-out-airport-shops-suck-balls/">JoeSportsFan Figures Out Airport Shops Suck Balls</a>).

The good news is that if you are from St. Louis you are probably saying &#8220;Eh, its not that bad.&#8221; because you have the luxury of never having to be trapped in it, while many people outside of St. Louis don&#8217;t even know what Lambert is like because nothing flies through here ever any more. We hear Delta is thinking about just taking Labert out of the equation totally, making St. Louis visitors just jump out of the plane instead of choosing to actually stop here. Granted, that&#8217;s Delta where most would rather just jump out anyway instead of being treated to the free, and mandatory, anal rapping service Delta gives out these days when traveling with them.

Ah crap. We told you this news but we weren&#8217;t standing in front of Lambert when we did it. Is that OK? Did you still understand it? We know that <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Lambert-ranks-third-on-list-of-worst-airports-101756088.html" target="_blank">apparently most TV news thinks your so stupid you can&#8217;t get it unless you are told news about something that they are standing right in front of</a>. \*cough\* KMOV \*cough\*

&#8220;Lambert Airport was rated the third worst airport. This is an airport behind me&#8230;actually its Lambert Airport. The thing I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221;

Ooooooohhhhhhhhh&#8230;got it. A first I had no idea what you were talking about, but standing in front of it with all the wind and stuff really helped. I&#8217;m still a little confused though, any chance you could show me stock footage of people traveling?
