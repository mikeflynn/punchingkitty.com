Social news site Reddit&#8217;s St. Louis community put on a little impromptu play using numerous fake accounts the other day in the comments of a post to the site entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/ibvr1/reddit_help_i_am_pitching_and_i_cant_make_an_out/" target="_blank">Reddit help! I am pitching and I can&#8217;t make an out!</a>&#8221; by &#8220;[RyanFranklin][1]&#8220;, a account faked in homage of the recently released St. Louis Cardinals closer.

There&#8217;s really nothing else that we can do other than show you a (probably now slightly outdated) [screenshot after the jump][2] (it&#8217;s a long image). Read the comments and check the byline for the characters such as &#8220;JoseQuendo11&#8221;, &#8220;tonylarussa&#8221;, &#8220;Mark_McGwire&#8221;, &#8220;DelTacoBuilding&#8221; and &#8220;FrancisSlay&#8221;

[Enjoy it in all it&#8217;s glory!][2]
