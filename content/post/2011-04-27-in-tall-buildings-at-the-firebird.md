Last Friday, the 22nd, while the rest of you were cowering in your homes because thunder is scary, our intrepid man about town, The Paparazzo, took in a show at The Firebird. The show featured the Chicago-based band &#8220;In Tall Buildings&#8221;, but our guy says the whole show was great.

You can see the full photo spread on <a href="http://bit.ly/e5pNNT " target="_blank">The Paparazzo&#8217;s flickr set</a>, and as for the headliners, you can download <a href="http://intallbuildings.bandcamp.com/album/warm-rock-single" target="_blank">two free songs</a> (which are both pretty great).

Here&#8217;s a photo of each act with links to their site.
