A man&#8217;s car and child are safe today, but early Sunday morning he was running down the street in fear of never seeing either of them again.

> According to police, the child&#8217;s father was dropping someone off at a home in the 4100 block of North Florissant around 4 a.m. The father was walking that person to their door when someone jumped into his running minivan and took off with the child still inside.
> 
> The father chased after the his van, but was not able to catch up.

Holy crap. Stream of conscious reactions&#8230;go!

1. Probably shouldn&#8217;t be leaving your kid alone for even a second, but&#8230;

2. &#8230;you&#8217;d like to think you can walk someone to a door without getting your car stolen.

3. Maybe next time just turn the car off.

4. Who you are dropping off at 4 am on a Sunday that you have to walk to the door?! You usually pack up the baby to go give your Saturday night bootie call a ride home?

> The car was found abandoned by police less than 10 minutes later. The child was unharmed.

Ah, ok. Good! So there you go: Leave your kid in the car and anyone that steals it will probably just leave it down the street when they realize there&#8217;s a kid in the back because, straight talk time, no one else wants your kid. Seriously. It&#8217;s not as cute as you think it is, and it&#8217;s head is still very oddly shaped. It shouldn&#8217;t still look like that.

The trick is to leave some snacks and a blanket in the car because it will get awful cold on the street at night, and everyone needs an emergency bag of Fruit Loops handy.
