Found on <a href="http://thedirty.com/2010/03/16/dirty-drive-thru-2/" target="_blank">The Dirty</a>, this photo submitted by one of their St. Louis readers really makes you feel proud to live in St. Louis doesn&#8217;t it?[
  
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3851" title="dirty drive thru" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dirty-drive-thru-.jpeg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/04/dirty-drive-thru-.jpeg 480w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/04/dirty-drive-thru--300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />][1]

Not sure if she&#8217;s new to the whole fat person motorized vehicle thing, but you would think she&#8217;d be able to get a little closer to the curb there. Especially since we both know she&#8217;s not going to put out any effort when they hand the &#8220;food&#8221; out to her.  Also, there&#8217;s a very real danger here that this person slowly escaped from some mental institution in town like a hospital&#8217;s psych ward, or the Post Dispatch offices.

The worst thing about this photo? Its not the first time we&#8217;ve seen this.
