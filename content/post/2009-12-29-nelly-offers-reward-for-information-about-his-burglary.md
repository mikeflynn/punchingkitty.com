Please note the fine print.

> Nelly is offering a $10,000 reward in addition to the CrimeStoppers reward for **information that leads to the felony arrest (not arrest and conviction)** of the person or people responsible for the burglary to his Wildwood home.

Nelly likes to throw some of his money around and be all bad like &#8220;I got robbed, but I&#8217;m totally rich even though most people can&#8217;t name a song of mine in the last 5 years, so I&#8217;m going to use $10,000 to get my stuff back.&#8221;

We aren&#8217;t impressed Nelly.

PunchingKitty is now offering 1,000,000 dollars for any information that leads to the arrest of Nelly&#8217;s thieves or information that leads to be getting photos of that bangin chick I saw out at Costco last weekend naked.**

Boom!

Who&#8217;s the player now Nelly?!  <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/12/29/leisa-zigman-is-giving-you-the-straight-dope-yo/" target="_blank">Tell &#8217;em Lesia</a>!

_** Only information that actually leads to felony arrest, or info that will get me photos of that chick and a night alone with her, which will start off with me introducing her to each of my stuffed animals individually and end with me crying like a baby and her quietly leaving while I&#8217;m in the bathroom, will be given the reward.  Also, only employees of this site are available to claim reward._
