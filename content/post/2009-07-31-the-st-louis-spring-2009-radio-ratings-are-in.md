Real quick review for those that may have forgotten or never heard of it:

> **Radio** is the transmission of signals by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those of visible light.[1] Electromagnetic radiation travels by means of oscillating electromagnetic fields that pass through the air and the vacuum of space. Information is carried by systematically changing (modulating) some property of the radiated waves, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase. When radio waves pass an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. This can be detected and transformed into sound or other signals that carry information.

Good, we are all up to speed now.

Here are the overall St. Louis Radio ratings, provided by Arbitron, for Spring 2009:

Things of note:

&#8211; In the latest from the Battle of the Sports stations, 101 ESPN (WXOS) creeps up to a 1.4, which is low, but pretty high in compared to the other combatants.  590 The Fan (KFNS) comes in at a 0.6 and 1380 The Team (KSLG) right behind them with a 0.5.  These numbers make sense just based on range alone, but another thing to note is that the time to make the big numbers is the &#8220;Summer&#8221; book since that is when the two AM stations can have their signal be the strongest for the longest time.   Its also worthy of pointing out that WXOS needs the bigger numbers way more than the other two, since the little AM stations basically can run on the same amount of money Sally Struthers gives to those Ethiopians each day.

&#8211; KMOX is still a monster.

&#8211; Are the Cardinals playing?  Oh well then give KTRS their extra points.

&#8211; Kind of a big drop from the Arch (WARH): 6.0 to 4.8.  Weird.

&#8211; The Point (KPNT) is just hanging on in there.  Though I have no evidence, I just get the feeling the Point might not be long for this market.

Those that know more about this than I, or have particular feelings for any of these stations, feel free to weigh in in the comment section.
