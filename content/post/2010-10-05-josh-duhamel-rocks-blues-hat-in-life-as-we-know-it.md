**Josh Duhamel**, <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/josh_duhamel_fergie_new_years_2009_1.jpeg?page=1" target="_blank">shown here with his husband</a>, is staring in the new movie &#8220;<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/lifeasweknowit/" target="_blank">Life as We Know It</a>&#8221; with **Katherine Heigl**.The movie is about two people who are polar opposites that have to take care of a baby. Uh oh! Sounds like this isn&#8217;t going to be what they signed up for! He&#8217;s probably a slob and she&#8217;s a little Ms. Perfect. This match up can&#8217;t possibly work! &#8230;oh wait, now it does! Roll credits.

What was the point of all this? Josh Duhamel rocks a **St. Louis Blues** hat in the movie, as evidence by these stills pulled from the trailer:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7148" title="life_as_we_know_it_2" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/life_as_we_know_it_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="233" />][2]

Good to see people out there representing for the Blues! Sure this one &#8220;fan&#8221; is a made up character in a movie no one will see, but that&#8217;s ok. After two wins, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/04/the-rams-won-again-everyone-just-be-cool/" target="_blank">St. Louis is all about their slightly less retarded football team</a> so the Blues will take any promotion they can get.

**Update!** &#8230;the baby isn&#8217;t a fan of our beloved Blues though. As pointed out by <a href="http://twitter.com/MattSebek/status/26476338312" target="_blank">@mattsebek</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thefilesfiles/status/26476731305" target="_blank">@thefilesfiles</a>, the baby later poops right in the Blues cap:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7188" title="Yeah, but the baby poops in it, dude" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/Yeah-but-the-baby-poops-in-it-dude.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="313" />][3]

The baby is clearly either a Blackhawks fan or a future Blues goalie.
