[<img class="size-full wp-image-2616 alignright" title="brendan ryan colby rasmus" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/12/DIRTY_phpfuZE29.jpg?filter=resize&w=300" alt="" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/12/DIRTY_phpfuZE29.jpg 500w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/12/DIRTY_phpfuZE29-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />][1]The quirky Cardinals shortstop that&#8217;s had a permanent reservation at **Tony LaRussa**&#8216;s dog house appears to be on his way out of St. Louis. After the Cardinals acquired ex-Cub Ryan Theriot from the Dodgers, the writing has been on the wall for **Brendan Ryan**, the mustachioed gentleman in the photo to the right taken a year ago when one of the local clubs had its douchebag collection on public display.

Is this really it though? Can&#8217;t Brendan sill rock out defensively, even though he can&#8217;t hit above his weight? Tell us <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/round-two/article_4d6426f2-fd74-11df-823f-00127992bc8b.html" target="_blank">Derrick Goold of STLToday</a>!

> The motive for moving Ryan is even more spurious. It seems like the Cardinals are willing to trade him not just because he had a down offensive year and remains a confounding riddle at the plate, but because his personality (his perceived personality) isn&#8217;t a fit. That is a flimsy reason to give up on his potential and give away his glove.

There you have it. Brendan is really out because there&#8217;s something about him that got under people&#8217;s skin, and clearly, as the photo above suggests, he was a bad influence on young **Colby Rasmus**. A dismembered Mickey Mouse shirt AND the flat bill hat with untucked chain?! You&#8217;re lucky you can hit Colby. Tony don&#8217;t play that.

If only Brendan was a little less weird and much crappier defensively, only then could he have most certainly become a Tony favorite like **Aaron Miles**. Alas, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be and it appears Ryan will be long traded before spring training begins.

In the meantime, you hard-core Brendan Ryan fans can <a href="http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10841218&cp=3302288.3383263" target="_blank">buy his locker nameplate from the 2010 season</a>:

Don&#8217;t all go rush to MLB.com at once now.
