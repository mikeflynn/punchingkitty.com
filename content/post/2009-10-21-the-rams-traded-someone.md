Here&#8217;s your scouting report from the Rams.  They are psyched.

> “Brandon is a young receiver that we have followed since training camp,” Rams GM Billy Devaney said in a statement. “He has good size (6-0 and 210), good hands and had a very productive preseason. His familiarity with our offensive system should help his transition to our team.”

Witherspoon was considered one of the better veterans on the Rams so do you know what this means to the Rams?

Nothing.  Losing is losing.
