[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1785" title="sexy_raping_cop" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sexy_raping_cop.jpeg" alt="sexy_raping_cop" width="222" height="345" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/sexy_raping_cop.jpeg 222w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/sexy_raping_cop-193x300.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" />][1]This sexy fella on the right is Officer Leon Pullen and he is accused of robbing 10 prostitutes and sexually assaulting at least three of them.

Using &#8220;online advertising&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: \*cough\* Craigslist! \*cough\*_] Pullen lured his victims to North County city of Uplands Park where he worked as an officer.  According to one of the victims, after meeting up with a prostitute responding to his ad, Pullen took her money and performed oral sex on her against her will in the police station, court documents allege.

The FBI decided to nab Pullen because of, and no, I&#8217;m not making this up, &#8220;fear he was about to strike again.&#8221;

As opposed to all the other reasons rapists are arrested?!  Yeah, they were going to let him do his thing because the local FBI wanted to catch the big game on Saturday night, but then someone said &#8220;What if he rapes another hooker tonight?&#8221;  Well, crap.  Great questions Johnson, now we all have to go arrest him right now!  &#8230;pffft.  New guys!

Pullen&#8217;s attorney has already submitted evidence that the accused was certifiably insane and has already suffered enough by forcing his face in to the snizz of a prostitute, to which the judge was like &#8220;Eww!  Yeah, totally!&#8221;

&#8230;I was just joking on that last part, but wouldn&#8217;t that have been awesome?
