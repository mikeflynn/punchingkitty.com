Promotional money well spent **Memphis Redbirds** (the Cardinals minor league affiliate). A giant crotch displaying Cardinal is sure to rile the kids up on game day.

&#8220;So just point out where on the Cardinal did they make you go inside of it.&#8221;

We couldn&#8217;t figure it out until now, but becoming a depressed weirdo after being screwed up by a giant inflatable Cardinal as a child might be how all those non-Chicago native Cubs fans are made.
