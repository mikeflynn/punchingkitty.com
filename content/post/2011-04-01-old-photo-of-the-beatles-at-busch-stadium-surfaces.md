(We&#8217;d never heard of them, but Steve Jobs told us they were a big deal, so we gave them a shot&#8230;not bad!) What the hell was the point of all this?&#8230;oh yeah, here&#8217;s one from St. Louis!

Pretty cool, to be sure, but these old photos are so grainy. Is that a jacked to the left of George or a figure? Time to bust out the CSI &#8220;enhancer tool&#8221;!

&#8230;this is where the computer is thinking but also making that weird fast beeping sound, as if that sound, every time a computer was processing wouldn&#8217;t be annoying at all&#8230;

Ding!

Oh we should have guessed! It was current Cardinal and future Cub first basemen, Albert Pujols in his whitey-tighty underwear hanging around the Cardinals clubhouse still&#8230;er&#8230;then. You make doubt our photo skills, but this enhanced photo does shed some light on why George seems so tense, all awkward and bundled up. If we were just 2 feet and a thin layer of stretchy cotton away from Pujols junk we&#8217;d be a little unnerved too.
