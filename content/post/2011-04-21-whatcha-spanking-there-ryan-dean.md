Our local NBC affiliate, KSDK channel 5, Â managed to make some noise on the national scene, but not the good &#8220;wow, what great reporting&#8221; kinda noise. More like Jimmy Kimmel laughing at you along with his national audience.

You know how we always say how much we hate all those live, &#8220;on the scene&#8221;, remotes that add no benefit to the broadcast? This one turned out to be worth it.
