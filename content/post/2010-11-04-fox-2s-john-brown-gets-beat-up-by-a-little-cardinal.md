<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKo80iviPo" target="_blank">Found on YouTube</a>: KTVI Fox2&#8217;s John Brown gets bit by a Cardinal he was holding at the bird sanctuary.

He apparently had named the little red cardinal &#8220;Albert&#8221;&#8230;not sure why. Don&#8217;t see any connection there. If he was making a joke, he should really come off his high horse and do something more relatable, because who knows what he was referring to. Maybe John will explain the obscure reference needed to understand why naming a cardinal &#8220;Albert&#8221; would be funny. Naming it &#8220;Fart&#8221;or &#8220;Boob&#8221; would have been far more universally hilarious.

At least the bird bit him, that we can all relate too.
