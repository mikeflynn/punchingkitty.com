The thugs of East St. Louis have broken the last barrier: They&#8217;re robbing you in church now!

> East St. Louis Police Chief Michael Floore said a call reporting the incident came into the Police Department at 5:12 p.m. about the armed robbery of people at IRA Grove Baptist Church, located at 1701 Belmont.
> 
> &#8220;Church service was going on when three masked gunmen went into the church and robbed the people who were there at gunpoint,&#8221; Floore said.

No one was injured and police are still trying to figure out what was taken from each of the patrons, but yikes&#8230;church&#8230;while services were happening. Also, we wanted to have a picture of the church via Google Street View, but when we typed in the address Google said &#8220;F*ck that noise! We&#8217;re not trying to go anywhere near there, even if it is digitally,&#8221; so instead, you get a freeze frame of one shot of the Arch in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udTBr7HFswY" target="_blank">the opening sequence of the late 80&#8217;s sitcom &#8220;Just the Ten of Us&#8221;</a>.

&#8220;They&#8217;re innovators man. True innovators.&#8221; (probably) said another East St. Louis hoodlum on hearing the news of the daring crime, while horribly mispronouncing the word &#8220;innovators&#8221;. &#8220;Who would have thought to rob people in church?! Genius. I was just stabbing a guy the other day while thinking that killing a guy at a funeral home couldn&#8217;t be topped, but damn, great idea: You can take the money people are giving to the church, and if you get thirsty, they always have wine on hand!&#8221;

_Upon hearing that someone robbed a church during servies the thugs of East St. Louis wept, as there were no more new places to rob people._
