Yesterday was a big St. Louis sporting news day!  Tony LaRussa made his [decision to return to manage the Cardinals for at least 2010 official][1] and confirmed the rumor that Mark McGwire would be on board as the team&#8217;s new hitting coach!

This is a major local news story that broke through the bounds of St. Louis and got national coverage.  Obviously the network synonymous with sports, ESPN, picked up and story and when they needed that local view they turned to the obvious radio station choice&#8230;KMOX?!?!

Ouch.  Now that&#8217;s gotta sting over the local ESPN Radio affiliate WXOS, 101 ESPN.  Its one thing to have a falling out in private, but to have your old flame have their new slut&#8217;s name all over the place?  Wow.  So sad.

Lets relive it shall we?

What do you have to do to not even get a phone call from the company you pay to broadcast their content?
