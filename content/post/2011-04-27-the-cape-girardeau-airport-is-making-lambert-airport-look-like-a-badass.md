If you&#8217;ll recall, Lambert Airport got wind-raped pretty hard last Friday. After getting its windows blown out and roof ripped off, it was back to full capacity yesterday, a mere 5 days later. The Cape Girardeau Airport has however been closed since Sunday because of puddles.

We&#8217;re not saying the puddles aren&#8217;t a legitimate problem, but when your airport is closed over the same things that little girls like to jump in with their rain boots, maybe don&#8217;t drop that news after another local airport got it&#8217;s face ripped off.

We will admit that puddles are an interesting foe. There&#8217;s only two options to go over them: make yourself look like at 6 year old trying to jump real far, or a ballerina, neither of which are real impressive to the ladies. Not all of us have a sexy body distracting enough to pull those moves off. That being said, puddles do allow for the occasional up-skirt reflection. But now they&#8217;re taking out our airports?! It would be a shame if Cape Girardeau was the place where our tenuous relationship with the puddles degraded in to violence*.

* violence = a mop
