> &#8220;The holidays are a great time for parents to not only have conversations about this in an empowering way,&#8221; [author Carrie Silver-Stock] said. &#8220;Ask your kids, &#8216;Have you seen kids sexting?&#8217; &#8216;Or have you noticed situations where there&#8217;s been harm?&#8217; So it&#8217;s opening up as it&#8217;s more of a dialogue that can be empowering for the young person but it&#8217;s also a great time for parents to look for clues.&#8221;

&#8220;Have you kids seen &#8216;sexting&#8217;?&#8221;  Really?  That&#8217;s the best approach.  Maybe throw turn your hat backwards first and mention the Music Television before moving in to the sexting questions.  Seriously, does anyone actually call it &#8220;sexting&#8221;?

Oh and why are the holiday&#8217;s a good time to do this again?  If its _so_ important, why not talk to them, you know, now? Eh&#8230;nevermind&#8230;the game is on.
