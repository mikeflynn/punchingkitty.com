Our honorable **Mayor Slay** spent part of his Monday at **Lewis Place**, an historic African-American neighborhood north of the Central West End that was hit hard by the infamous New Year&#8217;s Eve tornados. The neighborhood is an important one for the area because&#8230;

> The first black families to buy homes on Lewis Place ran into property-deed covenants that prohibited owners from selling to blacks. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned those covenants in a landmark 1948 case known as Shelley v. Kraemer, which involved a home at 4600 Labadie Avenue, less than a mile north of Lewis.

The mayor, joined by members of the local United Way visited the neighborhood, inspected the damage, talked about a donation drive and while they were at it, named Monday, January 17th, 2011 &#8220;Lewis Place Day,&#8221; which was fine because Monday, January 17th, 2011 wasn&#8217;t already anything else so it worked out perfect. Nope, nothing else at all&#8230;completely unclaimed. We can&#8217;t think of any related holiday that occurred on Monday, January 17th, 2011. Can anyone else? Show of hands.

  You sir! There in the front. Oh it&#8217;s already &#8220;your&#8221; day? Keep dreaming pal.

  Seriously though, we get that the Mayor probably thought it was cute naming a <strong>Martin Luther King Jr</strong> Monday to also be &#8220;Lewis Place Day&#8221;, but naming days are cheap can&#8217;t you just give them Tuesday? What you think the rest of the week is for white people?! Every day is &#8220;White people day&#8221; Mr. Mayor! (Except for May 5th and whenever Diwali is.) There&#8217;s no reason to &#8220;stack&#8221; holidays celebrating minorities like your trying to brush them out of the way!  Was today already taken by &#8220;White People Can Always Seem to Find a House Pretty Easily&#8221; day?

  Are you planning to start trying to &#8220;stack&#8221; up Yom Kippur and Hanukkah next, maybe <em>concentrate</em> those holidays in the summer like some kind of Jewish holiday summer <em>camp</em>? We&#8217;re not sure why you would call it that, but it would be in really poor taste.
