Joseph Emil Klug has two things that will follow him to the grave:

1. Joseph Emil Klug has to be one of the worst names of all time. Can you imagine having that societal lead weight at the top of every grade school test and the bottom of every check you sign? &#8220;Beverly, I love  you. Will you be Mrs. Joey Emil Klug?&#8221; &#8220;Eww. Pass.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to mess up a solid, no nonsense name like Joseph, but they freaking did it.

Where were we? Ah yes, the other reason why no one likes this guy&#8230;

2. He&#8217;s got a huge collection of porn! &#8230;No! No high-fives. Stop it!  &#8230;child porn.

> After an FBI search of Klug&#8217;s home, Klug said that he had 80-100 gigabytes of child porn, much of it featuring boys ages 8 to 13, prosecutors said. Investigators found the pictures and videos and discovered other images Klug had made by filming boys with a hidden camera, they said.

Klug plead guilty to charges of production and possession of child pornography, which was probably the best move considering the FBI found &#8220;59,000 pictures and 12,000 videos&#8221; on his computer. Saying &#8220;Um, I think all that stuff came on there when I bought it&#8230;.yeah I remember them saying a trial version of Word and 8 gigs of kiddie porn came with every E-Machine a few years back.&#8221; might have been enough for reasonable doubt though.

The question remains though: Did the horrible name cause him to be a pedophile or did his parents see this coming, thus giving him a horrible creepy name?
