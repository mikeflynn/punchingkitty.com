The Nebraska football stud quarterback that went on to get a Heisman and then be drafted by your St. Louis Rams as a wide receiver? Mad Mike Martz&#8217;s plan never really worked and after getting a real injury to go along with his hurt pride, Crouch retired just weeks before the regular season.

What&#8217;s he up to now?

> Crouch is now the owner of [Crouch Recreation][2], a company that installs park and playground equipment ranging from water slides to scoreboards in Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa.
> 
> &#8220;I made the mistake in my career [of] saying, &#8216;Just get drafted the highest position and I would be open to playing anything,'&#8221; Crouch said. “And when I got to the NFL, that really wasn&#8217;t the situation. I was really a quarterback at heart.&#8221;

Yahoo Sports goes on to mention that Crouch still gets calls from teams wanting him to get back on the field. UFL not NFL:

> To this day, Crouch is still getting calls. The UFL&#8217;s Omaha Nighthawks, an expansion franchise that already features &#8216;Husker legend Ahman Green on its roster and [tried out former Ohio State star Maurice Clarett][3] over the weekend, tried to lure Crouch out of retirement a couple months back. Crouch declined, pointing to the fact he&#8217;s had eight surgeries from football.

Good for him! It&#8217;s not often you hear about people being happy after leaving the Rams&#8230;well, other than Kyle Turley, Lovie Smith, Mike Martz, Marc Bulger, Tory Holt, and every one that went to a game last year.
