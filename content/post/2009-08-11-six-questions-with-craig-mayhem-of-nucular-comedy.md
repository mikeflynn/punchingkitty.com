To celebrate this momentous occasion, we thought it would fun to toss a few questions in the direction of the host of Nucular Comedy, Craig Mayhem.

For those that don&#8217;t know Craig, he describes himself as &#8220;weird, nerd-geek, midget bodybuilder, comedian, musician, author, liberal possible communist, and voice over artist.&#8221;  And honestly, that pretty well covers it.  He&#8217;s preformed around St. Louis both musically and comedically.  He also has a podcast at SuperFunPatrol.net where his claim to fame is personally angering a legion of Escape Club fans.

**Punching Kitty:** So you&#8217;ve done your Nucular Comedy nights for a little while now, but since this is the first one Punching Kitty is involved does it feel like all the previous ones were leading up to this?

> The ones leading up to this have felt sticky but his one feels small and fluffy and I suspect I&#8217;ll find a hairball in my shoe.

**PK**: Who would win in a back alley fight between Oprah and First Lady Michelle Obama?

> Is Gail there? Because I feel that would be important. If Gail&#8217;s there I&#8217;m going Oprah &#8211; if not I call draw. Oprah&#8217;s got the weight advantage, but Michelle&#8217;s got reach. Oprah&#8217;s a ground & pound style fighter and Michelle&#8217;s got 5 years of Muay Thai. One thing&#8217;s for sure, it would be hot at first and then dreadfully unsexy.

**PK**: If were a bird, what celebrity would you choose to poop on?

> Holy St. Vincent, there are too many choices! I&#8217;m going to go with Eric Estrada because I feel he needs some pub. Last I saw him, he was hawking phone service to people who don&#8217;t pay their phone bill. Ponch deseves better than that. He&#8217;s the Latino David Hasselhoff!

**PK**: Write me a haiku&#8230;go!

**PK**: Make up your own question and then self-answer it.

> If you could be a tree, what tree would you be?
> 
> I&#8217;m going to ignore that questiont. What I will answer is that I think people should accept who and what they are as long as they are willing to accept the consequences as well. Don&#8217;t make excuses for yourself. If you&#8217;re fat and not really planning on getting into shape, then fuck it &#8211; don&#8217;t make excuses, &#8220;I&#8217;m fat and I like it.&#8221; We can still work together &#8211; you can give my midget-ass a boost so I can reach the steroids.

**PK**: So tell us about Nucular Comedy.

> I love stand-up comedy, but I realized my chances of making it a career were pretty slim. I&#8217;m no Dane Cook (but who is, really?), plus I have a day job and a mortgage. I performed at least once a week for about 2 years and even opened for a famous person and got paid. But after a great club in the city closed down, there wasn&#8217;t a regular spot in STL City for comedians to get that all important stage time.
> 
> Ergo, Nucular Comedy. Stand-up&#8217;s a hard sell &#8211; especially during the week and that&#8217;s why I try to maximize the working-people factor. It starts fairly early, it&#8217;s free and you can&#8217;t smoke in there &#8211; Atomic Cowboy is a fabulous venue with great food, too.
> 
> And it features some great local comedians. They get stage time, the audience gets to laugh. Also I give prizes away and there&#8217;s dollar beers. I don&#8217;t get paid and unfortunately, neither do the comedians &#8211; I wish I could change that. It costs me money to do it because I pay for the prizes I give away out of my own pocket.
> 
> But don&#8217;t cry for me &#8211; I do it because I love it. Just come watch comedy and if you&#8217;re funny get on stage!

Come out on Wednesday to [Atomic Cowboy][4] at 8:30p to hang out with both Craig and myself!  You may want to bring a helmet to keep your head from exploding because of over-exposure to all the coolness though.  Ladies be sure to look hot because I&#8217;m taking photos and there will be a video camera!
