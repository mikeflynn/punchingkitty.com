[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8849" title="Adrienne-Martin" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/02/Adrienne-Martin.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="263" />][1]When we first talked about the mysterious death of celebrity, and ex-beer baron **August Busch IV**&#8216;s girlfrien**d Adrienne Martin**, the police initially focused the investigation towards a possible overdose after being found dead in a room in Busch&#8217;s mansion. Naturally, family and friends of Martin denied such claims with statements like&#8230;

> &#8220;She was against drugs,&#8221; &#8212; Timothy Carlson, former boss
> 
> &#8220;Adrienne was always very anti-drug.&#8221; &#8212; Dr. Kevin Martin, ex-husband

We had this to say at the time:

> The police are thinking overdose, [but] the family is poo-pooing on the overdose idea (but who’s family ever says to the press “Oh yeah. That was it! Totally overdose. My little darling loved her some nose-candy!”)

Well guess what was in the toxicology report! If you said cocaine, you&#8217;d be correct! Called it!

> The 27-year-old woman found dead at the mansion of former Anheuser-Busch chief executive August Busch IV had cocaine and the painkiller oxycodone in her blood, according to a source close to the investigation and her ex-husband.

This was a no-brainer. Healthy 27-year-olds just don&#8217;t die quietly without any signs of trauma in a dark room by themselves. Something had to make this happen, and despite her family&#8217;s claim of some rare heart condition, the smart money was on drugs. &#8230;the question now is: Where did she get the drugs in question? It&#8217;s not like she was dating a long-time playboy rich of booze money that has a history or drug and alcohol abuse. Too bad, that would make it so much easier to make sense of all of this.

> Busch could not be reached for comment.
> 
> His attorney, Arthur Margulis, said Saturday, &#8220;Having not actually seen the report, I have no comment at this time.&#8221;

What an oddly timed blockquote. We certainly weren&#8217;t inferring anything with our previous statement. Why else could she have been on drugs? Any idea mom?

> Christine Trampler, Adrienne Martin&#8217;s mother, has said her daughter was having trouble sleeping in the months before her death.

Yeah, we hear cocaine is great for getting to sleep&#8230;.right after doing the dishes, making enough sandwiches for an army, eating all the sandwiches and then being compelled to go to the east side at 2:15 pm on a Tuesday. So actually it works just like Ambien, just you do all that crazy stuff _before_ you pass out instead of right after.

Things are getting interesting for August Busch IV, aka St. Louis&#8217; Charlie Sheen.
