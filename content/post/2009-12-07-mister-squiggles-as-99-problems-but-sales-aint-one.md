Take for instance Mister Squiggles.  Every Christmas season needs an &#8220;it&#8221; toy and every year, some bastards try to take it down.  Why you gotta hate?

> The maker of Zhu Zhu Pets, one of the hottest-selling toys of the holiday season, defended its product after a consumer Web site said one of the robotic hamsters carries high amounts of a dangerous chemical.
> 
> Mister Squiggles, the light-brown version of the hamsters, has unsafe levels of antimony, said Dara O&#8217;Rourke, co-founder of GoodGuide.

Oh and its just the brown one that&#8217;s causing trouble huh?  Figures you would say that you racist motherf&#8230;

> &#8220;All our products are subjected to several levels of rigorous safety testing conducted by our own internal teams, as well as the world&#8217;s leading independent quality assurance testing organization, and also by independent labs engaged by our retail partners,&#8221; Russ Hornsby, CEO of [the St. Louis, Missouri-based toy manufacturer] Cepia, said in a written statement. &#8220;The results of every test prove that our products are in compliance with all government and industry safety standards.&#8221;

Although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony" target="_blank">antimony has its uses</a>, it is toxic and is allowable up to 60 parts per million, but a study found that our little friend here has 93 to 100 parts per million.  In small doses, antimony can cause headache, dizziness, and depression, but with larger doses stronger symptoms such as violent and frequent vomiting and possibly death.  Which all makes sense that this is from St. Louis, seeing as that is exactly how I feel when watching a Rams game.
