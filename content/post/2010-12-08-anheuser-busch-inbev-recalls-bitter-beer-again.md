Anheuser-Busch InBev Monkey Unicorn, the long-named local brewery, has had to issue its third beer recall in just over a month. This one because of this little issue of glass shards getting in to a few lots of Stella Artois 10-packs. Luckily this recall, as with the prior two, have been confined to Europe, also known as &#8220;Not Here&#8221; which means it went to terrorists, which is cool I guess. USA! USA!

Story&#8217;s over! Oh wait, no it&#8217;s not. First we have to let this guy say something:

&#8220;Oh an Anheuser-Busch product was gross and had to be recalled? How could they tell?! He he he. Look at my cat chest tattoo! Also I feel the need to tell you that I listen to bands that you probably have never heard of.&#8221;

Good one hipster beer guy. If you were going to write something to that effect in the comments but now aren&#8217;t because we beat you to it, take a picture of you punching yourself in the face, and post that instead.
