Oh how I&#8217;ve missed going through the stalker open market that is Criagslist&#8217;s Missed Connections section!

(Emphasis mine.}

> I was searching for a specific condom when I saw you hold a red, silk, teddy up to your perfect body. We locked eyes, smiled, and you turned back to the mirror. I left, but not before glancing at you. **You then gave me a thumbs up, as I walked out with my condoms.** If you can remember what brand of condoms I bought, please e-mail me back. I would love to see how that silk teddy looks on you! [[Source][1]]

Since this classy exchange happened at Johnny O&#8217;s in Florissant, I&#8217;m guessing we wouldn&#8217;t want to see either of them in their natural state. Â That being said, be sure to [check the picture Romeo attached to this particular missed connection][2] (NSFW)
