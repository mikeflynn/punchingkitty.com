Richard Nolan was arrested by the Illinois State Police after they stopped the 66 year old for &#8220;improper lane usage&#8221; and found eight duffel bags filled with marijuana. All told, Nolan has 118 pounds of the wacky tobacky in the car while driving on I-55/I-70.

Nolan&#8217;s picture (right) illustrating his jubliant demeanor means that it was either taken just _before_ they told him that he won&#8217;t be taking his luggage full of weed with him, just _after_ he helped himself to that special brownie in his pocket, the mugshot guy has really mastered the &#8220;look at the stuffed animal to make people smile&#8221; technique, or it&#8217;s just true that fat old people really are just jolly all the time.
