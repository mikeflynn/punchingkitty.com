Last week [we told you][1] of our refusal to join the mafia family of Fox 2&#8217;s deceivingly effervescent morning guy John Pertzborn, and then over the Labor Day weekend we get this!

Yup, that&#8217;s another Fox 2 personality, Kevin Steincross (@KevinStx) trying to spam us in to joining _his_ mafia family!

This means there are two distinct mafia families going on at Fox 2, both run by the most nasty, heartless men in employ there. Â Don&#8217;t let Kevin&#8217;s Twitter photo with his cat, or his cries for the return of [his lost Qdoba card][2] fool you, this man is a stone-cold killer.

We stand firm that we will not bow to the pressure from either Pertzborn or Steincross to join their families, and we are passing on the &#8220;protection&#8221; they are peddling.

Now, if Rich Gould makes us an offer&#8230;well, we couldn&#8217;t refuse that.
