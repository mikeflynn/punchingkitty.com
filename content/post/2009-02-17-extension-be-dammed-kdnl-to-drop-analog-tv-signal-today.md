We hear that despite the extension recently passed into law that now makes the Digital TV transition cut off June 12th, KDNL will make the &#8220;switch&#8221; and cut off their analog TV signal today, the original DTV cut-off date.

We&#8217;ve looked around and it seems all other St. Louis TV broadcasters will continue to push on with the analog signal until the new June 12th date.

For the record, we&#8217;re with KDNL on this one.  We&#8217;ve all had plenty of time to make the switch, and this push back is just costing everyone more money that they don&#8217;t have.  No matter when the switch happens there will be lazy / stupid people left in the dark, so why worry about them?  This kind of thing is best handled like taking off a band-aid: straight off in one move!

Of course one question is really on the mind of the people of St. Louis: When will channel 10 CityTV switch to digital?!
