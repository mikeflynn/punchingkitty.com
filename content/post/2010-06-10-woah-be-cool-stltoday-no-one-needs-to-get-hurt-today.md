Click on an ad? Sure. Whatever you want&#8230;um which one? Uh&#8230;we mean we don&#8217;t see them because they are so unobtrusive and not at all annoying when they roll over what I&#8217;m trying to read and can&#8217;t go back up. Look, if you want to keep paying Jeff Gordon to do who knows what, that&#8217;s fine. It has nothing to do with us&#8230;lets just not take this to a point where you can&#8217;t turn back man. Was it the racists in your forums that drove you to this point where you are pulling a piece on your web readers? We&#8217;re just trying to understand. &#8220;Site on site&#8221; crime really has to stop! Jesus, just one time cite a blogger as a source when they beat you to the punch!

Ok&#8230;ok&#8230;lets just take a deep breath. I didn&#8217;t mean to come at you that way, and you are still pointing a gun at me. We can figure this out&#8230;

I&#8217;m thirsty. I&#8217;m just going to reach down to get some water&#8230;woah! It&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool. I just need to reach in here, really slowly and get this&#8230;

Bad ass gun we&#8217;re turning sideways cuz we are crazy tough!

BAM! BAM! BAM!

Now we are going to bang your girlfriend, Suburban Journal.
