First the Rams seemingly regress and lose a winnable game to the woeful Seahawks.  During which SJ39 had to set Seahawks rookie Aaron Curry straight.  Don&#8217;t you step to SJ39!  Don&#8217;t do it!  &#8230;I&#8217;m warning you!  &#8230;aw!  &#8230;now you gone done it.  Its on!

> &#8220;Some guys don’t know how to be pros and I feel he has not learned that yet,&#8221; Jackson told 101 ESPN St. Louis. &#8220;Someone is over there not teaching him what it means to be a pro. It’s all right to jaw jack but unnecessary hits and taking shots at guys that are defenseless, or going after guys because they are high-profile guys and he is trying to make a name for himself, it’s not professional.&#8221;

> &#8220;You don’t get your name based on that because you’re going after another high-profile guy,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;You get your name and your status because of your work and your play in it. I’m just sitting there jaw-jacking a guy and letting him know that I’m not backing down. It’s obvious I’m injured, it’s obvious that I haven’t practiced all week and if we want to go head-to-head for 60 or 70 plays in a row, I’m willing to do so. I’m not going to back down. I’m going to let him know there’s a whole another monster, a whole another level in the NFL and this is not Wake Forest or the ACC.&#8221;

And then after all that!  &#8230;this happens:
