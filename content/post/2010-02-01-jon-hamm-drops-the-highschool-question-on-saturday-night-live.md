Jesus.  It&#8217;s come to this.  St. Louisian Jon Hamm hosted Saturday Night Live last night and dropped the old &#8220;Where did you go to high school?&#8221;  line to a national audience. Missed it?  We have the video below:

<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Yes, we know its just a line in one of those &#8220;last few of the night that really aren&#8217;t that good but if we don&#8217;t let the new guy get a sketch he&#8217;s written on the air soon he&#8217;s going to kill himself&#8221; sketches, but still this is getting out of hand.
