An 18-year-old man checked himself in to the Franklin County jail to serve his 30-day sentence, but he came with a little extra luggage&#8230;duct taped and tucked in to his ass. Here&#8217;s a hint as to what the tried to smuggle in: It wasn&#8217;t a sandwich, which is too bad because a sandwich sounds like a great thing to smuggle in. Just go with one of those stinkier cheeses and you probably won&#8217;t even notice the ass taste.

> According to Sheriff Gary Teolke, the man confessed to trying to smuggle a quarter-gram of heroin, a bend spoon, a syringe and a lighter wrapped in duct tape inside his behind.

Lets review&#8230;he had&#8230;in his ass&#8230;

1. a quarter-gram of heroin.

2. a spoon*

3. a lighter**

4. a syringe\***

<p style="text-align: right;">
  <em>* What! ** The! *** F*ck!</em>
</p>

What, no room for some post-heroin Cheetos fun size bags, or maybe one of those lumbar pillows? We hear those jail beds are rough. You&#8217;re going to wash that syringe first right?

> Deputies said the man was taken to the hospital, where an X-Ray confirmed the contraband. But authorities said the suspect was unable to get it out on his own and he refused to have it surgically removed.

Well of course! There&#8217;s no guarantee that all those doctors wouldn&#8217;t just shoot up all your ass drugs while you were still under anesthesia! You worked hard for that!

> Deputies said they sent the teenager home&#8230;

Wait, what? You can get sent home from jail because you have stuff stuck up your ass? Isn&#8217;t that the point of jail?!

> &#8230;where his parents eventually convinced him to go to the hospital. He then had the contraband removed by doctors.

If there&#8217;s any conversation tougher for parents than the &#8220;birds and the bees&#8221; talk, it has to be the &#8220;please let us take you to the hospital so we can get the heroin removed from your ass so you can go back to jail&#8221; talk.

> Authorities said they planned to seek charges against the man for attempting smuggling.

But now he knows the secret to get expelled from jail: Shoving things in your butt! Sure you&#8217;ll keep racking up smuggling charges, causing your poop to just kinda fall out, and soon you&#8217;ll have to be shoving herion-filled sleeping bags up there to keep pace with all the anal stretching, but&#8230;you know&#8230;no jail. So that&#8217;s sweet.
