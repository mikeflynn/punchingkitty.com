It&#8217;s the GPS unit that really scares us. Everyone in St. Louis has a gun, but this guy&#8217;s got a gun _and_ a map. He&#8217;ll find whoever he wants to find.

> Lee, 64, was parked at the Art Museum between 9:45 and 10:45 a.m. Sunday when the theft occured, police said.
> 
> No other vehicles were targeted by the thief or thieves, said department spokesman David Marzullo.
> 
> Lee&#8217;s belongings were stored inside a duffel bag inside the car, which also is missing.

You&#8217;d think keeping your belongings out of view while parked at the Art Museum at 10am on a Sunday, would keep you out of the high-risk car theft numbers, but you&#8217;d be wrong because this is St. Louis and if you&#8217;re not dead the city&#8217;s crime infestation is slowly hunting you down. That&#8217;s actually our new tourism campaign. It seems like a horrible way to go, but we&#8217;ve been told honesty is the best policy, so we&#8217;re conflicted. Here&#8217;s a few others:

&#8220;St. Louis: Yeah, It Turns Out We Do Have Director of Public Safety But He Says He&#8217;s Not Coming Back&#8221;

&#8220;St. Louis: Bring Two Wallets.&#8221;

&#8220;St. Louis: We&#8217;ve Got Lots of Food Trucks and a Few of Them Will Stop and Serve Food When It Looks Safe&#8221;

&#8220;St. Louis: Look, We Both Know You Aren&#8217;t Coming Here, So Just Buy a Shirt and We&#8217;ll Say We Remember You.&#8221;
