Here it is, in its entirety, for posterity:

I love that this Missed Connection plays out like classic Shakespeare.  A love story blossoms until the climax when the police came down on her like Tybalt on Mercutio, then the story turns dark and mean and diverges in to race relations and the ramifications of conceal and carry laws.

Not sure why it was flagged though.  Are there Missed Connection police that figured out this wasn&#8217;t really about love and yanked it?  I guess we&#8217;ll never know, but thanks to our tipster, it will live on with its Shakespearian undertones intact.
