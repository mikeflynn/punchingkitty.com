First off, well done Cardinals on making it past the Wild Card game and in to the NLDS! This new Wild Card game sure is fun! We hear it&#8217;s super popular in Atlanta right now. (Kidding. Even with the Cardinals winning, this game is stupid.)

For some reason we think it&#8217;s important to leave this link here to the definition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_fly_rule" target="_blank">infield fly rule</a>. It&#8217;s really not that hard to understand.

Also, let us not forget the late timeout call that give the Braves an extra strike&#8230;to which they used to hit a 2-run home run&#8230;and don&#8217;t forget that the Cardinals were up by 3, so that little play in question might have meant nothing if the next pitch got a double play.

That is all.

Check back on Sunday for the first game of the NLDS. Not sure if we&#8217;ll live blog it, or just do a Twitter thing, but we&#8217;ll do something.

&#8230;in the meantime, look at this sad Braves fan. He&#8217;s _still_ sad.
