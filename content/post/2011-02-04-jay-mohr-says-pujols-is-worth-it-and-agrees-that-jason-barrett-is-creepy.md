<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8vBir-SaU6A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

In this clip from **101ESPN** (WXOS)&#8217;s Superbowl media coverage, **Bob Stelton** interviews **Jay Mohr** and just before Stelton does the most obvious thing ever and asks Morh to do his Christopher Walken impression for the 23 Millionth time, Mohr gives the Cardinals some advice:

> **Mohr**: [Thankfully interrupting Stelton from whatever boring thing he was saying&#8230;] Are they going to pay Pujols?
> 
> **Stelton**: Yes they are.
> 
> **Mohr**: They have to.
> 
> **Stelton**: Unless he gets silly. Listen, if he starts asking for, you know, $35 Million a year&#8230;they gotta draw the line somewhere.
> 
> **Mohr**: He&#8217;s worth every penny.

Mohr goes on to say that the Cardinals are &#8220;pitching, Pujols, and a bunch of guys no one&#8217;s ever heard of.&#8221; We can&#8217;t disagree&#8230;well not totally. Uh hello?! We happen to think a guy that goes by the name of Aaron Miles had a lot to do with last year&#8217;s&#8230;uh&#8230;success. Mohr also goes on to do what everyone does when first meeting 101ESPN Program Director **Jason Barrett**: Recoil in fear, followed by laughter, then awkwardly befriend him&#8230;if Mohr had stayed at the table for another six months to a year he would have experienced the next phase: Barrett firing him.

Now if only they could convince Mohr to say the name of the radio station as Christopher Walken. Oh baby that would be sweet!
