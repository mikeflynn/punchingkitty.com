A state that has no property tax.

> As Americans prepare to file and pay their taxes, it’s come to light that Rep. Russ Carnahan may be skimping on his. The Congressman avoids paying personal property taxes on his 42-foot yacht by docking it in Alton, Illinois instead of his hometown.
> 
> “Illinois does not have a statewide property tax. Property is taxed on the local level only, and includes only real property such as land, buildings or permanent facilities.” (St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association; Taxes and Incentives)

Carnahan, shown on the right from the shoulders up taking a dump, named his boat “Attractive Nuisance” and he might have to change it now, because unlike other boat names, it now makes too much sense.
