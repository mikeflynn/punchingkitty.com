_Hear the World_, the hippie arm of Phonak, the hearing aid maker, sent someone out to popular St. Louis locations to see just how loud they were. They&#8217;re results were:

> **Market Street and Memorial Drive/I-70 Overpass** – 86 decibels
  
> **Soulard Market** – 83 decibels
  
> **Washington Loft District** – 76 decibels
  
> **South Grand and Juniata Street** – 75 decibels
  
> **The Loop** – 73 decibels
  
> **Ted Drewes** (Chippewa) – 72 decibels

Right away, who the hell cares about the ambient volume of the Market Street overpass? No one hangs out there. The Soulard Market makes sense too since it&#8217;s a talking-atmosphere. Washington, South Grand, the Loop all makes sense too simply because of all the traffic there.

Ted Drewes seems low though. Apparently 37 old ladies saying &#8220;Ummmmm&#8230;oh I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s just so much to choose from!&#8221; isn&#8217;t as collectively loud as we thought. Come back with an &#8220;annoying level&#8221; machine next time _Hear the World,_ see if your readings don&#8217;t spike then.

&#8230;oh and don&#8217;t sit the Annoying-meter down next to KSDK&#8217;s Mike Bush. The explosion would kill us all.
