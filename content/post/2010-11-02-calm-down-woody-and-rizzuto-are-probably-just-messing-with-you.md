We know that because we got a lot of traffic from people Googling for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=Woody+and+Rizzuto+suspended" target="_blank">Woody and Rizzuto suspended</a>&#8221; and messages from all over that went just like this one we got on Facebook:

> Any idea what Woody and Rizz said on the Point last week that got their show pulled this morning?

Well our readers are apparently Point fans and if they want to know what&#8217;s going down over at Emmis Radio, we&#8217;re happy to oblige! We tucked our suspensions away, pulled out our oversized magnifying glass and and started to sleuth around.

The Point&#8217;s site only had this to say on <a href="http://www.1057thepoint.com/WAR/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10157846" target="_blank">the morning show&#8217;s page</a>:

> FOLKS &#8211;
  
> NO WOODY AND RIZZUTO SHOW TODAY.
  
> MORE INFORMATION TO COME WHEN I GET IT.
  
> PLEASE KEEP CHECKING THE BLOG FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

> &#8211; PATRICO

Not really helpful&#8230;almost purposefully vague you might say. Hmm.

Nothing on their Twitter page, nothing on any of the St. Louis media internet haunts. Nothing from our sources. Nothing!

We got nothing.

&#8230;but in this case, nothing is _something_. Seriously.

Here&#8217;s how this works: No one gets suspended without people talking about it. Not the midnight guy on the Arch, and especially not the morning show on the Point. Chances are good that they simply took a day off and figured they&#8217;d steal some promotion out of it while they did it.

It&#8217;s actually <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/11/16/woody-and-rizzuto-not-suspended-just-put-in-time-out/" target="_blank">not even the first time they&#8217;ve done this</a>: Almost exactly a year ago, the same thing happened. Woody and Rizzuto weren&#8217;t on the air one morning and since there was no notice, people assumed they had been suspended. Nope, they just took the day off for reasons that had little to do with their on the air antics. I&#8217;m sure they were really bummed that people lit up their Facebook page all day last year though, just like today.

Chances are high they&#8217;ll be back on this morning talking in vague terms about their absence, letting you fill in the blanks to their once-a-year off day Mad Lib.

Sorry for ruining your shtick guys.
