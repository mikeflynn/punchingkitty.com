Break-ups. We&#8217;ve all been there. At first you&#8217;re so pissed off! You just want to go knock over trash cans and kick puppies. I mean, if you just saw her one more time, you&#8217;d&#8230;well you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;d do&#8230;but it would be something good, like telling her about that time you rubbed one out in her hand lotion&#8230;and mayonnaise&#8230;and shampoo bottle&#8230;and sock drawer.

In a few days you calm down though and decide to just get those feelings out with a note _with a cow&#8217;s tongue attached_. You know, nothing too crazy.

> An eastern Missouri woman has admitted that she sent threatening letters that included a cow tongue and opossum head to her girlfriend&#8217;s new love interest.
> 
> Thirty-nine-year-old Jessica Bradshaw of Troy pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in St. Louis to three counts of mailing threatening communications.
> 
> Trenton, Ill., Detective Chris Joellenbeck says Bradshaw mailed the threatening letters to her ex-girlfriend&#8217;s new girlfriend, who lives in Trenton.

First time we get a story on this site in over 1 and a half years featuring three lesbians and some tongue and its not even remotely hot. Figured.

Here&#8217;s a tip from Punching Kitty: If you want to creep someone out, don&#8217;t send a body part, send this creepy laughing doll (video below).
