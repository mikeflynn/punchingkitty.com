Early last Saturday morning Craig posted this to his wall:

> <h3 style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
>   I wish I could tell you all exactly what is going on&#8230; Let&#8217;s just say I shall return! mark your calendar and watch this page for a BIG announcement on: Feb 23, 2010! (That doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t hear from me sooner.) Just remember that date!!! You&#8217;re going to love it!
> </h3>

Hmmm&#8230;

Judging by the secrecy and imposed time limit of Feb 23rd, 2010, the words &#8220;No Compete&#8221; scream at you, but really who knows, and also, if its anything like the &#8220;super secret awesome plans&#8221; that former morning show hosts Steve and DC seemed to always have when they got fired, then I won&#8217;t hold my breath.
