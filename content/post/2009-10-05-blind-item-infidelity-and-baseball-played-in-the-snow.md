Which Cardinal infielder switched positions and bed mates over the last year or two?

We hear that this player has had lots of fun off the diamond without his wife and apparently isn&#8217;t at all shy talking about it.

This same Cardinal also isn&#8217;t shy about the amount of time he and 2 of his young-ish Cardinal teammates play in the &#8220;snow&#8221;. Â Maybe all the testing is about &#8216;roids and not about the party drugs?
