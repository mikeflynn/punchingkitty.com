This guy has some bacon, but he doesn&#8217;t like bacon, so instead of just returning the bacon from where it came from or throwing away the bacon, he decided the only option was to put it on Craigslist. Why didn&#8217;t he just give it to a friend&#8230;oh never mind. Starting to feel a little bit sorry for lonely bacon Cragistlist guy.

> Free bacon, I just don&#8217;t like bacon, serious inquires only, drop a text at \***\***\****

Yeah guys! Serious inquires only! No one better ask him if they can have his free bacon, but then not really want the free bacon! He doesn&#8217;t have time for those games.
