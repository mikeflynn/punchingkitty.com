49-year-old Larry Thompson was arrested and charged with aggravated battery, after punching his own mother at his home in Shiloh, Illinois.

He is also suspected of robbing a bank with Flattop and Pruneface, but escaped after detective **Dick Tracy** got the drop on his accomplices, only to have Big Boy Caprice put the squeeze to the coppers on the take so the whole gang walked. It was a setup see!

> Police said Thompson punched his mother in the arm in the 300 block of North Main.
> 
> Authorities arrived on scene in response to a domestic incident and took Thompson into custody.
> 
> He is currently being held on a $15,000 bond.

The man puts up all day with living on the wrong side of Illinois and looking like that, but something his old mother does makes him angry enough to punch her? What the hell could she have possibly done that&#8217;s worse than what this guy puts up with on a regular basis?!

The article doesn&#8217;t say, but we&#8217;re guessing he caught him doing&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221;&#8230;to himself, as that&#8217;s the only thing would seems abnormally punch-worthy to ole Larry. We&#8217;re not sure we&#8217;d punch our mom in that situation, but we also can&#8217;t say we definitely wouldn&#8217;t.
