> If you sons of bitches were not paying me to say that I liked u I would switch providers in a heart beat. ASSWHOLES [sic]

Service provider huh?  We&#8217;re guessing they are compaining about what everyone complains about: Charter  &#8230;or it could be that anal wart cream delivery service.  Bastards are always late.

Wait wait wait.  Are you telling me that when an on-air personality says something is awesome, they are sometimes just doing it for the money?!  Say it ain&#8217;t so!  The Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, massages with happy endings and Mark McGwire&#8217;s home run records are real though right?
