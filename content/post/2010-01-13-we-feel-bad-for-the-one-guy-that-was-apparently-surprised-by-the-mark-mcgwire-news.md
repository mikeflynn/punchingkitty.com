We here at Punching Kitty headquarters weren&#8217;t exactly surprised by Monday&#8217;s revelation that former home run champ and current St. Louis Cardinals batting coach <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/12/mcgwire-to-everyone-oh-those-steroids-yeah-i-took-those-sorry/" target="_blank">Mark McGwire finally came clean, admitting that he did in fact take steroids</a> during his career.

However we can&#8217;t say that about everyone.

One South County Cardinals fan apparently fell back against the wall clutching his chest while whispering &#8220;dios mio!&#8221; to himself like some old Latina woman.  Then he got angry and proceeded to do what angry people do, they go to the internet.

In a Craiglist posting entitled &#8220;Old McGwire Newspapers&#8221; our man has this to say (screenshot below)

> Been holding on to these old Post Dispatch special edition newspapers when [McGwire] broke the home run record. No value now. Maybe you can use them for fire kindling.

You think he&#8217;s sad now, just wait until he finds out pro wrestling is fake!
