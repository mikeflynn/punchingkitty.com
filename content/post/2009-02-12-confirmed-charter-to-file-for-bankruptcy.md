Charter, everyone&#8217;s favorite St. Louis cable monopoly, has filed for bankruptcy.  From [STLToday.com][2]:

> Cable operator Charter Communications Inc. says it will file Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization documents by April 1.
  
> As part of an agreement with debt holders, they will be paid in full and Paul Allen will maintain the largest voting interest in the company.

In a stark contrast to Monopoly rules, Charter will continue its &#8220;service&#8221; after filing for and throughout the bankruptcy process.

When asked if the quality of their service would take a hit because of the bankruptcy, Charter abruptly replied &#8220;No.  Seriously, how can we get any worse?&#8221;  &#8230;or at least thats how it went in my head.
