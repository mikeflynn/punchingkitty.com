In a statement, Mayor, Liquor Commissioner, Hotel Bellhop and whatever other hats the man owns said:

> This notice comes most directly as a result of a sudden rash of major violence surrounding and/or stemming from some of our liquor selling establishments. Up to this point, none of the homicides for 2009 have been directly connected to liquor. We suddenly have two.

Wait&#8230;what?  I don&#8217;t even know what to do with this.  &#8220;sudden rash of major violence?&#8221;  East St. Louis.  We are talking about East St. Louis.  &#8220;Up to this point, none of the homicides for 2009 have been directly connected to liquor.&#8221;   What?!?!  How can this stat be said?  Do homicides that are directly connected to liquor have to be a murder committed with a broken bottle?  Every other murder ever that started with an angry guy getting drunk doesn&#8217;t count now?  Even if we can agree on that insane premiss, you really think moving the cut-off time an hour or so back is really going to help?   &#8230;the way we see it, it will just make the murders happen earlier at night.

Yeah, this plan is going to work out great.  Get those &#8220;two&#8221; drunken murders down to zero and East St. Louis will be perfect.
