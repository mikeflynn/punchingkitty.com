Great.

Forbes Magazine says via [BizJournals.com][2]:

> St. Louis has been ranked the 10th-most miserable city in the nation by [Forbes magazine][3].
> 
> The “Forbes Misery Measure” looks at the 150 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S., or those areas with a population of at least 378,000. The list was based on nine factors: commute times, corruption, pro sports teams, Superfund sites, taxes (both income and sales), unemployment, violent crime and weather.
> 
> The Gateway City scored in the bottom half of all nine categories, the only metro area to do so, Forbes said.

When you look at where they &#8220;graded&#8221; the cities on, there&#8217;s really no surprise where we ended  up.  We aren&#8217;t (sadly) a public transportation city, corruption happens, no playoff teams, and you don&#8217;t really live here until your car gets jacked.  10th seems a little high actually.  

Seriously though, this is a complete bullshit rating system.  The fact that weather is in there really bends it over.  So people can&#8217;t ever be happy in Portland because it rains all the time?  What a crock.  This boys and girls is called link-bait, and yeah, we fell for it.

There is one good thing about this test though: Chicago came in as the third most miserable city!  Ha.  Just think how all the &#8220;Chicago Rules&#8221; yuppies have their panties in a bunch of this.  St. Louis is used to people shitting on us, Chicago isn&#8217;t .  Have fun with that.
