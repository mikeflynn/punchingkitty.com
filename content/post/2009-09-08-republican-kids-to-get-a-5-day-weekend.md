Snippets from her e-mail:

> President Obama’s Address to Students Across America September 8, 2009&#8230;
> 
> Word is traveling fast on the internet, between bloggers and twitter, the choice is clear : No school for kids on September 8th due to the beginning of Socialist Indoctrination of Americas children.
> 
> Take a day of vacation. Go to the zoo. Anything that would save your offspring from what I will bluntly say is just the quasi-fellating the executive branch.
> 
> I wouldn’t have such a problem with the Department of Education were this presented in a non-Orwellian fashion.  There is no consideration given to the authority of the American people. That’s what concerns me.

Once again, we don&#8217;t care about the politics because generally its not funny and thus doesn&#8217;t amuse us, but we don&#8217;t think its fair that little republican kids get an extra day home from school.  Granted, the liberal kids get to have a school day interrupted by an assembly, which no matter if the assembly is the President or one of those &#8220;Don&#8217;t Smoke&#8221; boy bands, its a pretty light day.  I guess thats kinda even.

Either way, I just think its funny that some people think their kids pay attention in school.
