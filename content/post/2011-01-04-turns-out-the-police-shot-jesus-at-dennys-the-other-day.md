Remember yesterday when we told you about <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/01/03/yet-another-way-to-have-dennys-kill-you-have-the-police-shoot-you-in-the-leg/" target="_blank">the guy that really really wanted to get in that Denny&#8217;s</a> on Hampton Sunday and ended up getting shot in the leg by the police? His mugshot was released after being charged with 1st Degree Property Damage and a count of Attempted Assult on a Law Enforcement Officer.

Turns out that dude was Jesus.

First off that officer shot Jesus, so he&#8217;s got to deal with that. Not sure how many Hail Marys something like that is, but it&#8217;s got to be over seven. Secondly lets let Jesus out of jail and give him the Denny&#8217;s he wanted. All Jesus wanted was a Root &#8216;n Tootie Fresh and Fruity after a hard New Years Eve protecting the city limits from <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/12/31/local-news-boner-alert-a-new-years-eve-state-of-emergency/" target="_blank">the dangerous storm that damaged all the surrounding counties</a> who, logic would then dictate, hate Jesus. Oh, well he was going to protect the whole city limits but he bent over to pick up a nickel and North St. Louis got a little nicked.  &#8220;Who would notice?&#8221; he thought.
