The Onion just posted an article, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/us-adds-4-million-jobs-but-in-st-louis,26759/" target="_blank">U.S. Adds 4 Million Jobs But In St. Louis</a>&#8220;. Here&#8217;s a sampling:

> The Labor Department reported Monday that the U.S. economy created a staggering 4 million jobs in October, though government officials hastened to add that the new positions are all located in the St. Louis metropolitan area.
> 
> &#8220;Though this much- needed job growth would bring our unemployment rate down to a far more manageable six and a half percent, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s St. Louis, so…&#8221;

Well done Onion! &#8230;but ripping on St. Louis in a delightful way that makes you think &#8220;They make fun because they love the city&#8230;but also because they&#8217;ve probably been mugged a time or five.&#8221; is kinda our thing, so please let us handle it.
