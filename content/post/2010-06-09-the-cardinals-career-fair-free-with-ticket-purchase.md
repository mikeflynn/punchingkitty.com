> <a rel="attachment wp-att-4916" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/06/09/the-cardinals-career-fair-free-with-ticket-purchase/cardinals/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4916" title="cardinals" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/06/cardinals.jpg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" /></a>The St. Louis Cardinals are excited to announce the 4th Annual Cardinals Career Fair will be held at Busch Stadium on Wednesday, June 30th, 2010 from 9 a.m. to 12p.m.
> 
> Organizations who have signed up to attend this year include: the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, Fox Sports Net Midwest, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Country Financial, U.S. Bank, GKN Aerospace, Gateway Grizzles, Cash&#8217;s Scrap Metal & Iron, Laclede Gas Company, U.S. Cellular and Coca-Cola Enterprises.

What a flashy list that at most will either net you a crap internship or working for Cash in his scrap metal shop. Bring gloves.

But how do I get in there? Is it free? No. You have to spend $20&#8230;but you get a free ticket to a Cardinals game. Â Or, as we choose to look at it: **You have to buy a Cardinals ticket to get in.**

> A $20.00 registration fee includes admittance to the career fair and one (1) ticket to the St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game that afternoon at 1:15 p.m.

Any other benefits? Sure you might see Andy Benes walking around as I believe he sold his soul to Bill DeWitt and they just use him for crap like this (Why else would he be killing rain delays with Fredbird?). Also though you get a chance to work with a company that is a complete and total shitpile and easily fires more people than they hire! Hello? Opportunity? &#8230;I think I recognize your knock!

> The attendees will also have the opportunity to take part in Radio Resumes this year. Radio Resumes will be presented by ClearChannel Radio during the Career Fair.

Wow awesome! Well I guess if you look at it like &#8220;No one forces more people to a career fair every year than ClearChannel!&#8221; that might make this seem cool for a second until they either get that slogan or start working the midday shift on The Bull, just waiting out the time until you&#8217;re replaced by one of those Steven Hawking voice machines wearing a cowboy hat.
