In the photo below Bill O&#8217;Reilly chats with Albert Pujols about&#8230;

A. O&#8217;Reilly: &#8220;Excuse me senior, but how long does it take you to cut Busch Stadium&#8217;s lawn?&#8221; Pujols: &#8220;Ha ha ha&#8230;that&#8217;s funny. Now you die.&#8221;

B. Which of the two of them is more loved in St. Charles County.

C. Bill&#8217;s checking for Albert&#8217;s green card and asking him if its ok he came to this country to take the job of a hard-working american first-basemen like Steve Pearce of the Pirates.

D. Albert was talking about the night&#8217;s lineup, thinking O&#8217;Reilly was LaRussa. All white people look alike.
