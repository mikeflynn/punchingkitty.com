It will be Apple&#8217;s biggest mall-based store ever, topping out at 6,000 square feet and will feature a new &#8220;Genius Lounge&#8221; area in the front of the store equipped with free WiFi and cute little emo Apple chicks that will convince you to buy another iPad (&#8220;Ok so you have one right? &#8230;now think about if you had two!&#8221; &#8220;Shit, that&#8217;s a good point. Sold!&#8221;) while you wait for your genius appointment.

> &#8220;According to mall observers, Starbucks is soon moving its coffee sales operation to the second floor, outside the entrance to the Nordstrom store that opens in September 2011,&#8221; Allen wrote. &#8220;Apple will then reportedly occupy the 592 square-feet permanent kiosk as a Genius Bar check-in space, Wi-Fi lounge and/or training space.&#8221;

> The &#8220;Genius Lounge&#8221; concept would be unique to the St. Louis store, a first of its kind for Apple&#8217;s highly successful retail outlets. The new store will occupy over 6,000 square feet, and will have a storefront 55 feet wide.

If you like getting to the Galleria and wading through the old people mall-walking in pastel jumpsuits, you can get a free celebratory t-shirt for being one of the first 1,000 through the doors Saturday morning starting at 9am. Be prepared for the neighborhood kid that wants people to think he&#8217;s smart because he&#8217;s on his computer all the time (but he&#8217;s just playing World of Warcraft and jacking off) to snort at your Apple love though. &#8220;Non-replaceableÂ battery huh? Classic Apple, always after your money!&#8221; he&#8217;ll say, and follow up with &#8220;Pffft. What about when you want to upgrade your graphics card to one with 512 mb of RAM or a maybe a solid state hard drive to optimize data throughput? Good luck doing that with Apple Care!&#8221; Go ahead and just punch him. It&#8217;s your best chance at feeling tough today.
