If you aren&#8217;t pumped about the Cardinals, you are gonna be after you want this!



What&#8217;s better than low-res photos of Cardinals cut together over a Creed song?  Nothing.  Well except for a half-and-half from Simone.

The question now becomes, is this guy going to recut this with [Lugo in place of Duncan][1]?
