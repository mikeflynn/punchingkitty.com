Go Cardinals! The spirit of 1982 is in you! &#8230;whatever the hell that stupid falsetto crap means. Nothing like a gayer version of Richard Simmons to sing and sweat you in to playoff success.

Trying something new tonight: The Facebook live stream. We have no idea if this is better, but WordPress sucks donkey balls for updating the site like we have in the past few live-blogging of games so we&#8217;re trying this out. Hopefully this is easy, won&#8217;t screw up your FB profile and will leave the comments around so people can read them later. Hell, if we&#8217;re throwing out wishes, I&#8217;d like you&#8217;re mom to stop sweating me, blowing up our phone all the time. Tell her we&#8217;re done. It was a 6-time thing. By the way, I&#8217;d stop hugging that teddy bear in your old room. It was heavily involved for times 1,3,5 and 6.

**[UPDATE: Facebook thing isn&#8217;t working. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/punchingkitty" target="_blank">@punchingkitty</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_ " target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a> for Twitter comments throughout the game.]**
