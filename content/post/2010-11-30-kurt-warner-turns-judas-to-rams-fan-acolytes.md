Kurt Warner won a Super Bowl for the Rams and a probable Disney movie with his ultimate St. Louis scrappy life story. We don&#8217;t remember all the details since no one mentioned it much&#8230;pretty sure it had something to do with stocking shelves at HyVee, football and praying to Jesus/CthulhuÂ that Trent Green would get hurt (totally worked!). Eh. Not important. The important thing is that he is a Rams legend and not matter how many random stops he did along down the final path to retirement, he will always be a Ram. Right Kurt?!

It&#8217;s cool. Whatever. The Rams only gave you your first shot and put you behind a offense with Marshall Faulk and a pair of great wide outs. Sure we &#8220;sent you packing&#8221;, but dude&#8230;seriously now&#8230;you weren&#8217;t any good. You needed a few years to get over getting &#8220;Martzed&#8221; in the backfield all the time, we had to move on. Sure you got to a Super Bowl with the Cardinals and the warm southwestern air <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/11/warners.jpeg" target="_blank">transformed your wife back in to a woman again</a>, but what else did they do for you Kurt?! Did they worship you with countless old faded Warner 13 jerseys packing the Dome each Sunday? Did Arizona give you a Kevin Slaten, your personal radio knob-slobberer? No, it doesn&#8217;t matter that no one remembers he still has a show, it&#8217;s not important, what is important that we love you Kurt!

WWJD Kurt? We&#8217;ll tell you what he&#8217;d do. He&#8217;d still be a Ram at heart. He wasn&#8217;t all like:

Think about that Kurt. Think about that hard. You just made Kevin Slaten cry. Are you happy now?!

Look for the &#8220;who does he love more&#8221; contest during the Rams vs Cardinals game this Sunday that Warner is providing the color commentary on.
