The Rams lost Sunday to the Vikings, but the game wasn&#8217;t without it&#8217;s moments&#8230;like when Danny Amendola spiked a football in to the face of some poor old usher standing behind the endzone.

Danny, here&#8217;s what you did wrong:

1. Chill bro. Great job on the touchdown, but you were way too fired up for a guy on a team that was getting stomped.

2. Technically that&#8217;s not even an endzone spike because you were way way way too far back. Do that kinda thing in the right spot: The _actual_ endzone. You might not be super familiar with it&#8217;s boundaries as you&#8217;ve been hurt and play for the Rams when you&#8217;re not hurt, but ask the Vikings.

3. Is this angst over being too short to do the &#8220;dunk over the field goal crossbar&#8221; thing?

Make this right Danny! Find this guy, hook him up with some cool stuff. Not just one of your jerseys and ball the Rams team signed, get him something good! &#8230;have the the 49ers sign it. Maybe get him a helmet&#8230;do you know Tom Brady?! If so get him to sign it. He&#8217;d love that!
