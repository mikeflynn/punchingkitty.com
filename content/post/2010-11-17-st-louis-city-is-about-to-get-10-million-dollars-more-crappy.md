With the city looking at a roughly $10 Million dollar deficit this year, it&#8217;s plans are to ask all departments to cough up some money. Sure maybe spend a little less on the constant road work, but not the police right? This city is already a freaking joke with violent crimes and theft, they wouldn&#8217;t be dumb enough to try and take money away from the thing that can fix the #1 issue with this city&#8230;would they? (emphasis added)

> To balance the budget this year, the city can refinance civil court debt, collect fees owed by the city water division, cut $1.5 million citywide and **ask the police department to return $2 million already promised**.

F*cking. Weak. Time to teach your children the accent art of  Nunchuckery. They&#8217;re going to need it on the mean streets of the midwestern Goham City.

So who&#8217;s fault is this whole $10 Million in debt thing? Several Alderman blame the Fire Department:

> &#8220;Every year since I&#8217;ve been here, the fire department spends more than allocated,&#8221; said 22nd Ward Alderman Jeffrey Boyd. &#8220;It just has to stop.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Can we pass an ordinance to stop the fire department from overspending without coming back to us?&#8221; asked 11th Ward Alderman Matt Villa.
> 
> &#8220;That money&#8217;s got to come from somewhere,&#8221; said 8th Ward Alderman Steve Conway, chair of the committee. &#8220;They have to come and ask us for it.&#8221;

Here&#8217;s hoping that one of the 100+ murders we have had this year is inspiring some guy to be Batman because that&#8217;s the kind of low public budget idea that might have any impact on our city.

Anything you&#8217;d like to add about your crime-ridden and debt-laden city Mayor Slay?

Hmm, don&#8217;t blame the cold. We wouldn&#8217;t rule out the &#8220;choking on your crappiness&#8221; diagnosis.
