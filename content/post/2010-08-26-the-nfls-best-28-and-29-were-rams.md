In the list the Rams snagged five spots, with the majority coming from the LA days. The old skool Cardinals snuck one in there too later on down the list.

#28 Marshall Faulk

> A key cog of the Rams&#8217; &#8220;Greatest Show On Turf,&#8221; Faulk played his last game in 2005, ending a career in which he produced 19,154 combined yards from scrimmage. His 6,875 yards receiving are the most by any running back. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.00-49/content.30.html" target="_blank">#</a>

#29 Eric Dickerson

> An electrifying open-field runner, Dickerson ran for an NFL-record 2,105 yards in 1984 and gained 1,800 or more rushing yards in three of his first four seasons. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.00-49/content.31.html" target="_blank">#</a>

#74 Merlin Olsen

> Before he became an actor and commercial pitchman, Olsen terrorized quarterbacks during his 15-year-career with the Rams and played in 14 straight Pro Bowls. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.50-99/content.25.html" target="_blank">#</a>

#75 Deacon Jones (beating out Mean Joe Greene!)

> A sack-master before it became cool, the 6-foot-5 defensive end teamed with tackle Merlin Olsen to give the Rams a &#8220;Fearsome&#8221; left side of the defensive line. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.50-99/content.26.html" target="_blank">#</a>

#85 Jack Youngblood

> Hall of Fame defensive end was a seven-time Pro Bowl pick in 14 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams (1971-84). Tough and durable, he played 201 straight games &#8212; and all of Super Bowl XIV despite a broken left leg. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.50-99/content.36.html" target="_blank">#</a>

Dan Dierdorf, of the defunct St. Louis Cardinals, was deemed the best #72

> The Hall of Fame right tackle anchored the Cardinals line over his 13 years with the club. He played in six Pro Bowls and following his retirement, he became an announcer with ABC and CBS Sports. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.50-99/content.23.html" target="_blank">#</a>

No Kurt Warner didn&#8217;t get #13, that went to <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1008/nfl.best.players.by.jersey.number.00-49/content.15.html" target="_blank">Dan Marino</a>. Kurt did get &#8220;runner up&#8221; status though.

One other name you might recognize: Your mom won #69 because she was big enough to be a linebacker and was a total slut. Snap!
