Times are tough everywhere, especially in the radio biz.  So tough that one of the staff&#8217;s favorite work perks over at Bonneville (the company that runs WIL 92.3, 106.5 The Arch, 101 ESPN and ToastedRav.com), free Starbucks coffee in the break room, is going away.  We hear the machine itself might stay, but the staff will be expected to pony up for their morning joe starting as soon as next week maybe.

Granted, in the light of [today&#8217;s other radio news][1], this seems pretty weak, but when you look at it like this is the last chunk of fat they could cut off before hitting meat (read: &#8220;people&#8221;) it gets a little scarier for those that work there.
