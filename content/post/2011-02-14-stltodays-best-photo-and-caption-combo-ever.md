[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8963" title="stltoday_pujols_turns_down_offer" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/02/stltoday_pujols_turns_down_offer.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="398" />][1]There&#8217;s a screen grab from today&#8217;s <a href="http://stltoday.com/sports" target="_blank">STLToday.com/sports</a> homepage on the right.

Do they think that&#8217;s how <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_7f511f48-37e0-11e0-b9d1-0017a4a78c22.html" target="_blank">Pujols reacted to the rumored offer</a> with only 7 years as opposed to his required 10? They think he reacted to it like that time Skip Schumaker ripped that nasty fart in the dugout and then tried to look all casual in the other direction to throw Pujols off the trail?

Maybe he did.

We&#8217;ll never know.
