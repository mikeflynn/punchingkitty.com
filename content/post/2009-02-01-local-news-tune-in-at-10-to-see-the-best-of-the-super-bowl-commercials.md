Oh yes, its that time again.  Super Bowl means one thing: A change for our local TV news anchors a chance to loosen their ties, after sports and the weather of course, to talk about their favorite Super Bowl commercials and giggle away as the lights dim and they pitch to a Seinfeld rerun.

Screw that.  You don&#8217;t actually watch the local news do you?  Of course not.  You get your weather and news online, so just go to [Hulu.com and see the ads on there][1].  

Feel free to insert your own sorta witty banter with that cardboard stand up of Mandy Murphy you made.
