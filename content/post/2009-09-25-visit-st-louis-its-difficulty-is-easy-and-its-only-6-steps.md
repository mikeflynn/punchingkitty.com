Apparently visiting our fair city is foreign enough to people that someone had to write an [article on eHow][1] describing the steps to take.  Here is a sampling:

> Difficulty: Easy
> 
> St. Louis is known as the gateway to the west and it was the first major settlement west of the Mississippi. St. Louis is home to three major league sports teams: MLB-Cardinals, NFL-Rams and NHL-Blues. St. Louis was home to the 1904 World&#8217;s Fair and is also home to many other attractions, and tourist attractions.
> 
> Step 4: Enjoy a cruise on the Mississippi River onboard either of two riverboats; the Becky Thatcher or the Tom Sawyer.
> 
> Step 6: Experience the thrill and excitement that is Six Flags theme park when you ride on on any of the adrenaline charged thrill rides and roller coasters.

Two things jump out at me here: 1. Is Six Flags isn&#8217;t much of a St. Louis attraction, I mean there are a bunch of them.  2. At what point can we stop talking about a fair that happened over 100 years ago?  Yes, it was a big deal at the time, but let. it. go.  We sound like the damn Cubs for christ sake!

Someone edit this and add something about reading Punching Kitty in step 7.  I would do it, but that wouldn&#8217;t be right.
