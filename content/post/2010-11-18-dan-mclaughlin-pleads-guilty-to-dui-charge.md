>   McLaughlin, 36, has completed community service and will serve two years&#8217; probation in the case, said his lawyer Jim Towey. As part of the plea deal, the state will not revoke McLaughlin&#8217;s license. Shortly after his arrest, the court issued a stay order, which means McLaughlin was allowed to drive while the case was pending.

  Next up for McLaughlin is the same thing all people say they&#8217;ll do after getting caught doing something stupid: Find peace and make their life better.

>   &#8220;It&#8217;s been something that has taught me the most valuable lesson of my life,&#8221; McLaughlin said Wednesday. &#8220;And I&#8217;m just trying to better my life and move on.&#8221;

  This could be tricky for the chatty and plump broadcaster since he&#8217;s done a remarkable job of <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/20/apparently-people-dont-like-dan-mclaughlin/" target="_blank">making everyone hate his ass</a> over the last few years.

  From a commenter:

> <p style="text-align: left;">
>   Yeah ran into him at a bar in da Lou once and he was a douche bag. Totally smug and full of himself. A KMOX intern who just got lucky and just another robo-announcer. St.Louis deserves better and I often listen to the other teams broadcast announcers to avoid him&#8230;couldn&#8217;t be happier his ass got taken down&#8230;

  Here&#8217;s one more:

>   some of the security guys at busch loathe the guy. the one constant in all the stories i&#8217;ve heard are the &#8220;do you know who i am?&#8221; types of responses they get to the &#8220;sir, you can&#8217;t park your car in a fire zone&#8221;, etc. normally you wouldn&#8217;t think too much of it, it&#8217;s just that the only other story like this i&#8217;ve heard from these same people are about barry bonds.

  Good luck with making amends, Danny Mac! Maybe stay away from the charity golf tourney&#8217;s with open bars (and buffets) would be a good start.
