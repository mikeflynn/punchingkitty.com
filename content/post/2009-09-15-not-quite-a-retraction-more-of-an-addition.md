Yesterday, when talking about [Chris File appearing in the Up in the Air trailer][1], we said this, emphasis mine:

Is that Chris Files, **host of The Toast which is the diamond in the rough that is ToastedRav.com**, in the new Up in the Air trailer walking behind star George Clooney?

We forgot to mention that Chris isn&#8217;t the only diamond in the rough!  He has a buddy left in those charred remains of a media experiment: Their movie critic Roger Qbert!  We love his movie ripping articles!

You know, come to think of it&#8230;maybe we could use a movie critic here at PK&#8230;.
