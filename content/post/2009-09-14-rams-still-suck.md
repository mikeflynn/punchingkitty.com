In case you couldn&#8217;t hear through the buzz, the Rams still suck.

Jeff Gordon said it well on his blog post:

> The Rams have a new upper management team and a new head coach. Most of their assistant coaches are new, too, as are roughly half the players on their opening roster.
> 
> But the Rams have the same old problems. The Rams started the 2009 season by making a slew of mental, physical and emotional mistakes on both sides of the ball.
> 
> Their offense proved feckless, despite an enormous financial investment in their offensive line. The Rams didn’t run block and they didn’t pass block well, either.
> 
> Their defense finally collapsed after an encouraging start. After forcing three turnovers in the first half, this unit got manhandled in the second.
