[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8879" title="i_choo-choo-choose_you-748156" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/02/i_choo-choo-choose_you-748156.gif?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]Basing their rankings off of sales data of romantic novels, relationship books, romantic comedy movies, Barry White albums and various &#8220;sexual wellness&#8221; products per capita since the first of the year, Amazon.com has placed St. Louis at number 18 on it&#8217;s Most Romantic City list.

To us that sounds more like St. Louis has relationship issues than one that&#8217;s naturally romantic. Why buy all that crap if you&#8217;re just naturally gifted with the ladies? Clearly we are a lone wolf of romantic sexiness in St. Louis because we sure don&#8217;t need Barry White albums. We tried to play some music to calm a lady friend down, but it really didn&#8217;t seem to help. Hell, she probably couldn&#8217;t even hear it from inside the trunk.

Here&#8217;s the top ten:

> 1. Alexandria, Va.
  
> 2. Knoxville, TN
  
> 3. Orlando, Fla.
  
> 4. Miami, FL
  
> 5. Ann Arbor, Mich.
  
> 6. Columbia, SC
  
> 7. Cincinnati
  
> 8. Murfreesboro, TN
  
> 9. Gainesville, Fla.
  
> 10. Tallahassee, Fla.
