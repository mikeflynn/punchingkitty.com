Yup, right there on the front page of STLToday&#8217;s Cardinals Sports page you find Derrick Goold of the PD <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and&#8230;</span> twittering away while he follows around Cardinal players in the early beautiful Florida mornings.

For the record, we think this kind of stuff is great and we definitely like it as opposed to just having the one Twitter account that blasts out every story.  Those types of Twitter accounts are great for blogs (like this one!) but for big sites and TV stations, its just a little too much&#8230;like drinking from a fire-hose.  Having Goold actually on the other end sending out quick notes is a nice change of pace and something we can follow without having it take over our Twitter stream.
