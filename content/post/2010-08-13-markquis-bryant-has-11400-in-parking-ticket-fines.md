In KMOV&#8217;s &#8220;Is This Why We&#8217;re Broke&#8221; segment, they dealt with people flaking on parking tickets. The story is largely boring and pays no mind to the fact that every other city in the world probably has the same, if not worse, problems collecting fines like these, but there is one interesting part.

The #1 parking offender is Markquis Bryant and he owes some $11,400 in parking ticket fines!

> According to the the treasurer&#8217;s office, the top offender is a man named Markquis Bryant. Bryant&#8217;s plate (9AK19F) has racked up 117 open tickets for a total of $11,400 in fines. When asked about Bryant the assistant treasurer said, &#8221; this guy is awful lucky he hasn&#8217;t been caught yet.&#8221;

Bryant has been in jail and now, shocking, is recently back in jail. Unanswered however, is the obvious question of: Ok, if he&#8217;s not going anywhere, get that money St. Louis!

Or not. Apparently St. Louis just likes to just remind these people about the money they owe like some little guy everyone takes advantage of. He&#8217;ll try to bring up the subject at the end of a dinner party, its not like he wants to ruin the night, or make it awkward, but you know, he does owe him that money. Yes&#8230;it&#8217;s time! Lets go talk to him about this finally. &#8230;Eh. He looks busy. Maybe another time. He just wants people to like him.
