Hey there! w4w eh? Nice&#8230;

Here&#8217;s hoping &#8220;oatmeal cookie&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;amazing night of crazy lesbian sex where one of us is dressed as a sexy librarian and the other one as a school girl and involved all the hot stuff and none of the weird stuff that lesbians probably prefer but doesn&#8217;t fit with male fantasies&#8221;

&#8230;also we hope &#8220;think about it&#8230;&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;I taped it.&#8221;
