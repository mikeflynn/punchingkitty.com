Its not just the little stick stations that are hurting in this craptacular economy.

You can tell by the number of Later Day Saints PSAs airing on 101 ESPN (and I&#8217;m assuming 106.5 The Arch, and 92.3 WIL) that advertising is slim even for Salt Lake City&#8217;s own Bonneville.

Just listening to 101 when running some errands recently I learned all kinds of values like how I need to ask my kids about where they are going and what they will be doing with their friends. Â Good tip.
