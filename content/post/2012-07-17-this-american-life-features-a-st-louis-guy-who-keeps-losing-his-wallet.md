We now know all kinds of stuff about St. Louis&#8217; own Julian Venegas. We know this stuff because Anton DiSclafani, a St. Louis writer, found Julian&#8217;s wallet one day and became obsessed with returning it to him&#8230;and then later retold the tale on the NPR radio show <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/469/hiding-in-plain-sight?act=2" target="_blank">This American Life</a>.

> ACT TWO. OBJECTS MAY BE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR.

> <a href="http://english.artsci.wustl.edu/DiSclafani_Anton" target="_blank">Anton DiSclafani</a> tells the story of her desperate search to find a stranger who left something on her porch. Anton&#8217;s book _The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls_ comes out next summer. (8 1/2 minutes)

Much like Anton, we found Julian&#8217;s Facebook page pretty quickly. In fact, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julian.venegas.14/posts/445560008811489" target="_blank">here he is commenting on the This American Life piece</a>. And here&#8217;s Julian drunk wearing a wrestler costume for what we hope was a Halloween party:
