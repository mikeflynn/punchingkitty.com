After <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/04/20/jill-devine-out-at-the-bull/" target="_blank">Jill Devine&#8217;s departure </a>from the ClearChannel owned 93.7 The Bull, the word was that her sucessor was to be Jim Doyle, <a href="http://stlmediastuff.blogspot.com/2010/04/jill-out-jim-in-at-bull.html" target="_blank">as reported by STLMedia.net</a>. We&#8217;ve heard this isn&#8217;t the case.

As soon as today, Devine&#8217;s, now vacant, morning shift will be filled by a two-man out-of-town morning show, not Jim Doyle. _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Is that was she said? &#8230;hmm. Maybe.]_

We don&#8217;t know the names of the gentlemen running St. Louis&#8217; newest morning show but we can take a pretty strong guess that they probably work cheap.
