The Rams are probably going to suck, but who cares about analysis?! What does Katie Kearney, the current Miss Missouri, think?

We bet she&#8217;s gonna be brutal on them dude! She&#8217;s totally going to destroy their week linebacker core and pick apart the shaky Quarterback play! Oh man, she&#8217;s going to be all over them and definitely won&#8217;t just be some stereotypical overly optimistic beauty queen to the point where you&#8217;ll wonder: &#8220;Why the hell did anyone bother to ask her, let alone print it in a newspaper?&#8221;

> **Reporter:** OK, let&#8217;s cut to the chase. How many games do you think the Rams will win this year?
> 
> **Miss Missouri:** “I&#8217;ll say 24.”
> 
> **Reporter:** Uh &#8230; wait a minute, they only play 16 games.
> 
> **Miss Missouri:** “I&#8217;m counting exhibition games, playoffs, the Super Bowl &#8230;”
> 
> (Startled reporter furiously begins doing math in his head)
> 
> **Miss Missouri:** “I&#8217;m very optimistic.”
> 
> **Reporter:** Fair enough. OK, who is your favorite football player?
> 
> **Miss Missouri:** “My dad, Tim Kearney.”

Never mind.
