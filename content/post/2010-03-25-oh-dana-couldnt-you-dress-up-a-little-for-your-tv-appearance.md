If you guessed LOGO, you should really read the internet more often. The answer was of course Fox News and in particular, the Bill O&#8217;Reilly show where Dana was on to talk about recent Tea Party rally where allegedly racist remarks were yelled at our very own African-American State Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver.

Here is our summary:

> **Dana Loesch**: Hi I&#8217;m Dana. I decided to dress punk princess to make sure I&#8217;m different than all the other TV people and in the presence of O&#8217;Reilly I&#8217;m way more cutesy than normal.  Also I think&#8230;
> 
> **Bill O&#8217;Reilly**: I like to interrupt everyone, even people that are on my side of the aisle, which even if you agree with me, makes my show very difficult to watch. No one understands but whatever, lets talk about the rally.
> 
> **Dana**:  I looked at a lot of video of the rally and its clear this was a leftist plot to make up the fact that no one actually said anything racist.  And another thing&#8230;
> 
> **Bill**: Well look, just because there&#8217;s no video of it, doesn&#8217;t mean its not true. We have no reason not to believe the Congressman.
> 
> **Dana**: He&#8217;s from my state. [Sarah Palin wink]
> 
> **Bill**: [Ignoring her.] We don&#8217;t know&#8230;
> 
> **Dana**: Well.
> 
> **Bill**: it was that was&#8230;
> 
> **Dana**: Yeah&#8230;but&#8230;
> 
> **Bill**: but clearly something was said, but it annoys me that this is news.
> 
> **Dana**: Totally. Don&#8217;t forget about this other thing that I think should have been important but no one agrees and I&#8217;m still trying&#8230;
> 
> **Bill**: I don&#8217;t care either actually.
> 
> **Dana**: I still can&#8217;t believe people would make this issue up!
> 
> **Bill**: How do you know its made up?
> 
> **Dana**: Because its wasn&#8217;t on video.
> 
> **Bill**: That&#8217;s dumb.
> 
> **Dana**: But this Congressman voted for health care so he must be a liar.
> 
> **Bill**: I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s even too crazy for me.

Seriously, that&#8217;s how it went down. We swear, and watch for your self below (the jump).

I think no matter your politics, we can all agree that it&#8217;s really something when you&#8217;re farther right than Bill O&#8217;Reilly.

Sorry Dana (and fans) for a little ribbing, but we haven&#8217;t poked fun at Dana for a while.  We think she&#8217;s cool with it&#8230;
