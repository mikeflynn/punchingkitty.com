In a completely unrelated story, outspoken conservative mouth-piece and general easy-going #1 fan of Punching Kitty.com [_Editor&#8217;s Note: \*cough\*_] <a href="http://thedanashow.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Dana Loesch</a> recently won a week-long all-expenses paid trip to &#8220;anywhere but here&#8221; by a little known company named **F**lowers **B**y **I**rene.  A mysterious black van will be picking her up when she least expects it later this week.

What. Are. The. Odds?!  Have fun Dana, and enjoy your stay Mr. President!

[_Editor&#8217;s Note: Call me&#8230;let&#8217;s do lunch Mr. President!_]
