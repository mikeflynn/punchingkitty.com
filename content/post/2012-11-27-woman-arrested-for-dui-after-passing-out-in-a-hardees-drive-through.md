Janice Lyles was arrested Saturday after being found passed out in a Godfrey, Illinois Hardee&#8217;s drive-through, engine running and everything. Hardee&#8217;s must get like one of these a week, but it&#8217;s still pretty funny.

> The staff at the restaurant, located in the 2700 block of Godfrey road, called police when they notice a woman asleep in the drive thru with the engine running.
> 
> According to police, Lyles displayed obvious signs of being under the influence of alcohol and failed field sobriety tests.

The &#8220;obvious signs&#8221; of course included the fact she was asleep, and most importantly, she thought eating at Hardee&#8217;s was a good idea.

That&#8217;s Janice pictured above. There&#8217;s no mention in the police report about when she found an <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/11/ed-asner.jpeg" target="_blank">Ed Asner</a> mask, cut too very tiny eye-holes in it, and had a truck run over it before putting it on, but as the mugshot illustrates it must have happened at some point.

> She was arrested and taken to Madison County Jail. Lyles was charged with DUI, and held on a $100 cash bond.

Janice expects to be found guilty or face a plea bargin which, with today&#8217;s tough DUI laws, would be expected to draw a penalty of a suspended licence and to be forced to eat her Hardee&#8217;s order sober.
