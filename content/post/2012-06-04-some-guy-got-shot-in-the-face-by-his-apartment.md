<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/05/02/stop-shooting-people-in-their-faces-you-assholes/" target="_blank">St. Louis&#8217; totally uncool obsession with shooting people in the face</a> continued over the weekend when a man was shot (in the face) while leaving his downtown apartment.

> Officials say the victim was driving outside the Mansion House Apartments off Memorial Drive just after 3 p.m. when two suspects walked up to his SUV and shot him.

Dude.

We really don&#8217;t want or need to get in to the long history of people getting shot in the face in our city, or why that&#8217;s just not civilized. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/05/02/stop-shooting-people-in-their-faces-you-assholes/" target="_blank">We&#8217;ve done that.</a> What we are going to do is put up or &#8220;No Face Shots&#8221; campaign logo and then go get a quick snack, clear our schedule for the rest of the day and then head back to the computer because we just spent some time searching the internet for &#8220;blasted in the face&#8221;, &#8220;face shot&#8221; and &#8220;asians with big boobs&#8221;, and while we didn&#8217;t find what we were initially looking for, we found a bunch of other stuff that made us forget what the original thing was and why we were upset about it. Bye!
