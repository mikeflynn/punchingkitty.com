[ByronCrawford.com][2] has a new post up with a photo walk through the Adult Entertainment Expo (or &#8220;AEE&#8221; to you pervs that know the names of porn directors and stuff).  

&#8230;but first, a tip for you young, just starting out-type bloggers from Byron:

> I&#8217;ve noticed for a while now that the websites of alt weekly newspapers &#8211; like the Village Voice, and the Riverfront Times here in St. Louis &#8211; will run these photo galleries where they send someone out to the club with a camera to get pictures of broads with their cans hanging out of their shirts, and I&#8217;ve heard that these are often the most popular features on those sites. If I can remember (and I wouldn&#8217;t count on it), I might have to start posting them here on a regular basis.

Well said.  Maybe some of you read Hell Yeah Bitch! .com and our groudbreaking &#8220;Gratuitous Kate Beckinsale&#8221; series?  (Check it: <http://hellyeahbitch.com/?s=kate+beckinsale> )  I think Abe Lincoln said it best: &#8220;Chicks = Hits.&#8221;  Always true.  

Anyway&#8230;  More from Byron:

> And after the jump, I&#8217;ve posted a few of my favorites, along with commentary. With it being the gay-ass Village Voice, there&#8217;s a lot of pictures of guys, and other pictures you don&#8217;t need to see as much.

Check them out&#8230;good photos, and good commentary: <http://www.byroncrawford.com/2009/01/the-five-people-you-meet-at-aee.html>

Also, Byron has one of the best &#8220;tilted-headed black guy&#8221; photos of all time on the right of his site.  As if you needed _another_ reason to click on a link right?
