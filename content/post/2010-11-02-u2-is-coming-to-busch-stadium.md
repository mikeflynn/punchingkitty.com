Mega-band U2 has been booked for a July 17th, 2011 appearance at our very own Busch Stadium! Announced Monday afternoon, the Cardinals are bringing the bands &#8220;360 Tour&#8221; and its musical spectacle packed in 120 semi trucks to the Busch Stadium field.

> Take the largest stage and tour production in history, one of the greatest bands of all time with three decades of hits, add the world class Busch Stadium, and you have the formula for an evening you&#8217;ll never forget.

&#8230;especially if you are on the Cardinals grounds crew who will have to quickly re-sod the entire field after the concert before the Cardinals return home. It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re having a big party and Mr. Pujols&#8217; place and have to make sure it&#8217;s super clean so he doesn&#8217;t find out.

Though the Cardinals say that most of the tickets will have sub-$100 prices, ranging from $32.50 to $252.50, we assume that&#8217;s just the face value of the ticket. Just below that price you&#8217;ll see:

Service charge: **$5.00**
  
St. Louis Fun Tax: **$2.50**
  
Pujols New Contract Tax: **$23.25
  
** Holliday _Previous_ Contract Tax: **$13.75
  
** Aaron Miles Tax: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>&#8211; </strong></span><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>$0.60</strong></span>

That Aaron Miles, always giving back to the fans! Seriously though, please retire.
