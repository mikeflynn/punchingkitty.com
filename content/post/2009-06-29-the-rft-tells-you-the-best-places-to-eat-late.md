Egan O&#8217;Keefe from The Riverfront Time&#8217;s Gut Check blog has a photo gallery up of [the best places to eat after midnight][2].

We here at Punching Kitty don&#8217;t agree much with the first &#8220;establishment&#8221; on the list, the Eat Rite diner. but we understand its significance.

What do we like? Â Although it didn&#8217;t make the list, we will always love City Diner on South Grand.
