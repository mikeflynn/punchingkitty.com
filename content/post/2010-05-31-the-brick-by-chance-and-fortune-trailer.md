Taking a break from a full set of posts today because its a holiday and this CSI marathon sure the hell isn&#8217;t going to watch itself.

I did want to post up something though, and for your holiday post you get a chance to watch something too. Friend-of-the-site, Bill Streeter has released a trailer for his new documentary &#8220;Brink by Chance and Fortune&#8221; which is about the lovely brick buildings in St. Louis and the history of that industry and you watch see below.

Our favorite part is when <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/?attachment_id=4754" target="_blank">the little professor guy</a> talks. He&#8217;s magical.

Can&#8217;t wait to see the whole thing later on this year!
