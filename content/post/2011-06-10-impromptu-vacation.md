Sorry everyone! We&#8217;ve traveling the last few days, but we thought we would have Internet access throughout&#8230;but that didn&#8217;t end up being the case, so we&#8217;re on vacation now we guess.

There are definitely things we wanted to weigh in on, so we may try to get something written or worst case, just be late to the party when we get back to St. Louis. 

We&#8217;ll be back at it in a few days, and you would not believe how long it took us to write this on our phone with a shoddy cell connection.
