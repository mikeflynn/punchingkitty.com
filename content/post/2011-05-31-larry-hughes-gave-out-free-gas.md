The former NBA player and St. Louis native dolled out $4,500 in free gas in $30 dollar chunks to the first to arrive at a particular gas station. Hughes also signed autographs and allowed photos to the motorists while gassing up. Good for you Larry!

Also congrats are in order for ourselves since despite all those &#8220;gas&#8221; references and we still totally resisted the urge to make any fart jokes! Now do you see us all up in arms saying we deserve free gas money? No, you don&#8217;t. Heroes set themselves to a higher standard.
