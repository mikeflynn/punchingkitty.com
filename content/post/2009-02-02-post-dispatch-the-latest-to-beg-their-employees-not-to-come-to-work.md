Add the Post-Dispatch to the list of bleeding old-media companies that are forcing everyone they can [read: non-union employees] to take a one-week unpaid furlough.

From [BizJournals.com][1]:

> The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has ordered all 300 of its nonunion employees to take a one-week unpaid furlough.
> 
> The newspaper also suspended all 2009 merit raises for nonunion workers and the company match for its 401(k) program.
> 
> The Post&#8217;s parent, Davenport, Iowa-based Lee Enterprises (NYSE: LEE), is $1.3 billion in debt, mostly due to its acquisition of Pulitzer Inc. in June 2005.

You really have to wonder how long the Post-Dispatch will be along this form.

Any of you work at the PD?  What&#8217;s the vibe like there?  Send stories to tips[at]punchingkitty.com or just leave a comment.
