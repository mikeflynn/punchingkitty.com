When Freese was stopped he pulled the &#8220;Do you know who I am?!&#8221; routine!

Seriously.

Here&#8217;s a note to all you &#8220;St. Louis Celebs,&#8221; when your ass is in the fryer, and you ask &#8220;Do you know who I am!?&#8221; its a douche move even if you are Albert Pujols, but its a whole crazy new level of douche to do it when you are basically a minor league third baseman that has had a cup of coffee in the bigs and his only real skill of power seemingly evaporate like that little bit of foam left in a keg cup.

Douche move Freese. Â Douche move.

Clearly you never got taught the tough lessons in the minors from Kevin Costner.
