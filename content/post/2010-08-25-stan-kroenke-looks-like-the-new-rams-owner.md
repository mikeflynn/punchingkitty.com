First there was the sudden claim of the team from Shahid Khan, then the NFL rules he had to dodge about cross-city ownership, and after all that, he had to be all like &#8220;Dude. I don&#8217;t have the money, but I promise I will have it soon. Be cool. What happened? You used to be cool.&#8221;  None of that matters now because the NFL finance committee has unanimously voted in favor of our man Stan.

> The NFL’s finance committee has unanimously recommended approval of Stan Kroenke’s Rams purchase bid, the Post-Dispatch has confirmed through several league sources.
> 
> The finance committee will make its report and invite discussion Wednesday in Atlanta. At that time, Kroenke can comment or respond to questions as he chooses, and then the vote will take place.

The final vote will happened later today at the NFL owners meeting, but from here it looks to be smooth sailing for Stan Kroenke. Congrats Stan!

By the way, we have some issues with your new purchase: The team sucks, the arena they play in is crap and even with a #1 drafted quarterback, you still can&#8217;t put enough butts in the seats to get a home game shown on local TV.

Kroenke&#8217;s only issue? St. Louis&#8217; lack of direct flights to L.A.
