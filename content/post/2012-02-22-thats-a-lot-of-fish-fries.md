It&#8217;s Lent (for Christians anyway) and so begins fish fry season in our Catholic church laden town. So what&#8217;s a St. Louisan to do who wants to hit up as many fish fries as possible? Well grab your defibrillator and head over to <a href="http://www.cravescavesandgraves.com/2012/02/fish-fry-season.html" target="_blank">Craves, Caves and Graves.com</a> where some awesome individual has taken the task of detailing as many local fish fries as he can find.

> Today I was looking for a fish fry in the area of a trivia night we are doing on Friday night (that may be the most &#8220;St Louis&#8221; sentence I&#8217;ve ever typed) and I had to mentally map out parishes between my house and the trivia night, and then look them up. There is no central fish fry website, as far as I can find, and my Google-fu is strong.

This is called giving back to the community, and we kinda feel like we helped since we&#8217;re telling you about this cool thing this other <del>guy</del> girl _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Whoops!]_ is doing. We&#8217;re good people, and we believe that no matter what that homeless guy said in between us kicking him in the ribs. Like he didn&#8217;t have enough quarters already?! Look, everyone knows it totally sucks when you get to the Quiktrip and you don&#8217;t have enough change for the fountain soda. Oh just break my $20? Whatever homeless guy. We can tell by your several coats you have no idea what kind of a pain it is to break a $20, so don&#8217;t act like you do!
