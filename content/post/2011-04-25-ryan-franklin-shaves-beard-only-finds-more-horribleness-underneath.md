So that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to play it this year huh Franklin? Times get tough and you lop off trademark-able facial hair? _(<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_cbb949b0-6c0a-11e0-beb4-001a4bcf6878.html" target="_blank">ahem</a>)_ We wouldn&#8217;t do it. Maybe we were fans of the Oklahoma Sooners (just an example) and whenever they had a bad game would we&#8217;d go out an shave the mane off the mascot? We don&#8217;t stand out there on the sidelines telling them to shave something to see if that will help them suck less!

You don&#8217;t shave your long-standing fashion statement. I don&#8217;t care who you are, or what you say, or just because we spent your money to come here to watch you grow that beard, and you happen to make <del>one bad pitch</del> _several_ bad pitches and give up <del>a</del> _butt-loads of_ homer(s) so you are going to start shaving stuff?

He was supposed to be the best closer in the National League. Yeah right!

_**Update:**_ In a shocking move, Franklin&#8217;s beard has vowed to not take the blame for his creator&#8217;s horrible pitching and has taken to the mound himself! Going an inning and a third with two strike outs, a walk and a run, the formally attached beard showed that pretty much anything, even a ratty clump of hair, can do better than Ryan Franklin right now. The beard is expected to be added to the 40 man roster by days end.
