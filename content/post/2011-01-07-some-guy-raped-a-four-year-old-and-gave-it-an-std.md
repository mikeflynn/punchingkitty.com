He also gave her a My Little Pony for Christmas but is anyone saying anything about that?! No! Of course not. Always focusing on the negative. You people make me sick!

No, but seriously, the rape thing is probably the bigger story here.

> James M. Davis, of East St. Louis, is charged with statutory rape in the first degree. The abuse allegedly occurred between October 31st, 2009 and January 14th, 2010 in an apartment in St. Louis County.

We realize it&#8217;s pointless to ask, but why the hell would you rape a 4-year-old? Seems like a lot of trouble, and you&#8217;re going to get caught. People have a rough time taking a 4-year-old to WalMart, let alone trying to give one an STD or two.

In the future, Jimmy, we&#8217;d reccomend a Flesh Lite other such device rather than 4-year-olds. This is, of course, assuming you don&#8217;t get your dick ripped off in prison by a large man named Deke.
