Why? Because the University of Central Missouri is an important&#8230;um&#8230;it&#8217;s a school that everyone remembers exists&#8230;well, not really&#8230;it&#8217;s um&#8230;well, out of all the fake doctoral degrees out there, University of Central Missouri&#8217;s is&#8230;uh&#8230;definitely&#8230;one of them.

> The university says Clinton is being honored for his commitment to education and philanthropy as well as his service to the country as president. The school&#8217;s announcement cites his work, through the William J. Clinton Foundation, in promoting health and economic development initiatives worldwide.

Sure, what the hell right?

Also, we all know Mr. President likes &#8217;em big and there&#8217;s no place better to hypnotize some big fat girls in to having weird sex with you than the middle of Missouri!

&#8230;also, if recent history with Missouri universities holds true, Clinton will talk a good game, and then bail to to speak at the University of Arkansas at the last second.
