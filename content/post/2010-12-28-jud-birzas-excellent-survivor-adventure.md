Jud Birza, just off his exciting Survivor win, is back in town for the holidays this week and while working out at a local YMCA, Birza gave KMOV some of his time for an interview with the St. Louis&#8217; newest &#8220;million dollar man&#8221;.

The interview is great, but not in the way KMOV or Jud would have hoped. You should really watch it. Don&#8217;t watch the whole thing though, it&#8217;s brutal. If only there was a way for you to just watch the funny parts all edited together&#8230;duh dude! That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for!

Check out the&#8230;um&#8230; abbreviated version embedded below. It&#8217;s totally righteous dude!
