So you&#8217;re a thug ok?  You see a car idling on the street, and you think.  &#8220;Wow, doesn&#8217;t get much easier than this!&#8221;  So you hop in and start to drive away.

And  then you get shot &#8220;several times&#8221; and die.

Its like the damn wild west in North St. Louis!

> An 18-year-old north St. Louis man was fatally wounded Sunday as he attempted to steal a truck.
> 
> It happened near Baden around 10 a.m.
> 
> Police said a 31-year-old man left the truck running in front of his house in the 8400 block of Church Rd. and went back inside.
> 
> Charles Winfrey Kemp, of the 4400 block of Forest Park Blvd., approached the vehicle, attempted to drive it away and was shot several times by the owner.
> 
> Kemp was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Now before you go patting Mr. Vigilante on the back for his conceal and carry brand of justice, he&#8217;s freaking crooked too.

> The 31-year-old man, who was not identified, was taken in to custody for outstanding warrants.

&#8220;No one&#8217;s going to steal _my_ car!  I stole that shit fair and square last week!&#8221;

We don&#8217;t venture in to North St. Louis much, but for those that do, when you go up there does all the color fade away with the exception of a few highlights?  You know, like Sin City?  Are there gangs of unregulated hookers chopping off heads in the streets?  Because that&#8217;s how it sounds.

Look, if you see a car idling, just let it be. Don&#8217;t try to steal it. Also, don&#8217;t just leave your car idling in North City&#8230;unless you are packing heat, then I guess, do whatever.  You win.  Sorry about your small penis though.
