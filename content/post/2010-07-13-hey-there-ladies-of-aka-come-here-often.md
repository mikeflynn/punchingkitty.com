We saw a really crazy flick that started out just like this&#8230;

> More than 10,000 Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority members will be in St. Louis this week for a weeklong convention.

Blah blah blah&#8230;honoring people&#8230;blah blah blah keep our clothes on. Whatever stuffy press release! &#8230;what if we had you this beer bong and pour Apple Pucker on you like this&#8230;?

Oh we&#8217;ll give you a one size too small white &#8220;Punching Kitty&#8221; t-shirt too.

Anything?

&#8230;the aforementioned movie lead us to believe the ending to this would be different.
