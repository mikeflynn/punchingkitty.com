Mardi Gras weekend is in the books for another year, and whether you abstained from this year festivities or partook, but don&#8217;t remember, it&#8217;s ok, because cell phones and YouTube are here to help! Here a few of our favorite YouTube uploads from Mardi Gras weekend:

### #3: The classic drunk girl that &#8220;needs&#8221; to get to a far away bar with her passed out friend

Don&#8217;t give them a ride! One, you know that passed out friend will puke the minute her ass hits your back seat and two, she &#8220;needs&#8221; to go to that bar to meet a guy&#8230;it&#8217;s always a guy&#8230;so that theory you&#8217;re working with right now where she gets there and is so grateful she touches your wiener, will not happen. We repeat: It will not happen.

### #2: The inevitable dance off

You get enough people together and supply booze, costumes and feather boas and the chances of a dance off reach 100%, but being in Missouri, the chances of the dancers being any good, drops to around 6%. Good dancers, don&#8217;t do dance offs&#8230;only the weak ones that think they are great do. Thankfully, someone caught one on video, and it&#8217;s lameness didn&#8217;t disappoint.

They&#8217;re just lucky we weren&#8217;t there, we would have killed them. However, our dance offs always start late because we have to go around telling chicks that don&#8217;t want to be carrying our baby soon to back up. It&#8217;s not because we&#8217;re so good at dancing we might get your preggers&#8230;that&#8217;s ridiculous&#8230;it&#8217;s just that when we dance there ends up being a large amounts of seaman sprayed around. It&#8217;s the magic of the dance.

### #1: Falling straight backwards is always funny

No one falls straight back. You see people fall forward, or to the side, but the straight back fall is a rarity and that&#8217;s probably why it&#8217;s so damn funny. The video&#8217;s a little hard to see, but seeing this unicorn of a fall really puts a bow on the whole weekend.
