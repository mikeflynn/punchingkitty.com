The news is not surprising, but it&#8217;s gotta be tough to give up that sweet gig, but it&#8217;s not clear if this means he will also be losing his 100k+/month salary from AB Inbev as a special consultant, product taster and official &#8220;makes sure the couch doesn&#8217;t float away&#8221; guy, which was negotiated during the buyout.

One less pseudo job means he&#8217;ll have even more time to date ladies! We&#8217;d say to make sure you have really good insurance if you dare date him, but let&#8217;s be honest, after the first date no one&#8217;s going to cover you with all the risk involved.
