> The winner of seven notable awards including, “Best Cinematography”, “Jury Award”, “Audience Choice Award” and “Best Dramatic Feature” has partnered with the Landmark and Wehrenberg Theatres in Saint Louis for the film’s initial national launch.
> 
> Streetballers, which is the highest-scoring film in the 17-year history of the Saint Louis International Film Festival, is an Irish-Urban drama that explores the lives of two junior college basketball athletes, Jacob Whitmore and John Hogan. The film descends into the underworld of Streetball, an unconventional form of basketball where the rules are as unpredictable as the players. With both characters struggling to find sanity amidst a world of drugs, alcoholism and racism, the two worlds collide revealing a story of hope, transformation and a challenge on the courts of the city’s tough Northside – a story all too familiar with the filmmaker and basketball aficionado Matthew Scott Krentz.

Here&#8217;s the trailer:
  


The debut is tonight for the press, but we sadly have plans.  If any of you are headed out there, we&#8217;ve love to know how it went by sending a review our way!
