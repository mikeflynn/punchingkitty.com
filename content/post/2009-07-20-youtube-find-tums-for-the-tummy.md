Maybe it was a childhood reared on Mr. Rogers watching him show me how crayons are made, but I love seeing factory tours.  In that vein we found a clip from KETC, channel 9, where they toured the St. Louis Tums factory!  &#8230;its a little boring and &#8220;PBSy&#8221; in the beginning, but once the actual factory tour starts its pretty cool.

Unless its just me that gets geeked up about stuff like this&#8230;if thats the case then we are showing this because its ironic lame, like all those &#8220;old&#8221; tshirts they sell at Wal-Mart, and proving that we are straight punk.

(I have the video embedded below, and its set to start at the good parts.)
