From the press release:

> The St. Louis County Police Department, West Count Precinct and City of Fenton Precinct will co-host a Citizen Police Academy at the Rockwood Band Meeting Room 1037 Majestic Drive, Fenton, Missouri 63026.  The classes will be held on eight consecutive Thursdays, beginning on September 17, 2009, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, with graduation on November 5, 2009.

From the _Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol_ IMDB summary:

> A new batch of recruits arrives at Police Academy, this time a group of civilian volunteers who have joined Commandant Lassard&#8217;s new Citizens on Patrol program. Although the community relations project has strong governmental support, a disgusted Captain Harris is determined to see it fail.

This is going to be awesome! &#8230;well thats assuming there is at least one skinny black guy that makes funny noises in Fenton.

The amazing Michael Winslow everyone!
