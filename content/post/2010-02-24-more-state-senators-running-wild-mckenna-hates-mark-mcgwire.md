Seriously, what the hell is wrong with our state senators?!  First they <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/02/15/whats-the-point-of-a-titty-bar-with-no-titties/" target="_blank">hate on poor defenseless nudie bars</a>, then they try to <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/02/16/st-louis-zoo-wont-charge-you-stop-whining/" target="_blank">strong arm the zoo</a>, and now&#8230;well they are kicking a man while he&#8217;s down.

> A Missouri state senator is trying to remove Mark McGwire&#8217;sname from a five mile stretch of Interstate 70 that runs through St. Louis. It&#8217;s the same lawmaker who pushed for the road to be renamed in honor of McGwire after his 1998 home run fueled season.

> State Senator Ryan McKenna says that it&#8217;s now inappropriate in light of McGwire&#8217;s steroid admission.

Ok, so McGwire was taking the roids while we all collectively gave him a fan-job. Yeah, thats bad. But you know what? At the time he was basically a god and all we did was take a little stretch of a highway in the ugliest part of downtown and basically fake named it.  Yes, fake named it.  Its not really the Mark McGwire highway, its just highway 70&#8230;with a sign over it.

And now Senator McKenna wants to take the sign away.  Probably just so he can look cool and win the next election to state senate&#8230;you know because of all the power he wields.

That&#8217;s all.  He&#8217;s not &#8220;un-naming&#8221; anything, he just wants a sign taken down.  At this point, who gives a crap?  The dude knows he screwed up, and at this point who cares about a sign on the north part of downtown.  No one seems to care about the other ones there, like &#8220;Please don&#8217;t shoot other people.&#8221; or &#8220;It would be great if you would take a dump on the street homeless guys.&#8221;

We know its probably unpopular decision, but we at Punching Kitty say **Don&#8217;t Take McGwire&#8217;s Sign!**

Who&#8217;s with us?!
