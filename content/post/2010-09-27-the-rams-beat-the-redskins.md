> The Rams (1-2) won for only the second time in 29 games overall behind a strong start and even stronger finish, with the biggest offensive showing under second-year coach Steve Spagnuolo.

The 30 points put up by the Rams Sunday was the best total in not only Coach Spagnuolo&#8217;s tenure but the most since beating the Cowboys in week 7 of the 2008 season.

> &#8220;We&#8217;ve put in a lot of hard work for this,&#8221; [Rams quarterback Sam] Bradford said. &#8220;To get to celebrate with those guys, it was a great feeling.&#8221;

We&#8217;re sure it does feel good Sam! New owner Stan Kroenke even made point to congratulate each individual player in the locker room after the game. Google even gave the St. Louis Rams an appropriate hotness level of &#8220;mild&#8221; in becoming the 26th most searched term moments after the win.

The Redskins weren&#8217;t riding quite as high&#8230;

> &#8220;Did the Redskins practice this week?&#8221;, Sam Huff, Redskins&#8217; radio commentator

> Brian Mitchell, in the Comcast SportsNet post-game: &#8220;This is a terrible team at this point&#8230;.The game I saw today reminded me so much of last year, it&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;

As pointed out by <a href="http://twitter.com/MattSebek/status/25620733436" target="_blank">JoeSportsFan.com&#8217;s Matt Sebek</a>, not even head coach Mik_e_ Shanahan_&#8216;s_ attempt to embody the &#8220;Redskin spirit&#8221; by sitting in a tanning booth all week could get the team going:

If there is one really fun thing about backing an epically bad team it&#8217;s the joy of ripping the few people we do actually manage to beat in to pieces. Thanks Redskins!
