Oh thats right ladies!  St. Louis might not have Fleet Week, but this year we have The 2009 U.S. Chess Championship!

> Two dozen of the nation&#8217;s best chess players will be invited to participate in the 2009 U.S. Chess Championship, which will be held at the new Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis. The tournament, which dates back to 1845, will take place from May 7 through 17, 2009 and will offer a purse of more than $130,000 in prize money.

If you&#8217;re not sure where to find the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis, its the building with the crazy long line of fine ass pussy rolling out of  it 24/7!  

> The 24 invited players will include: 
  
> the top 12 American players by rating, using the April rating supplement; 
  
> the top two female players by rating, using the April rating supplement; 
  
> the 2008 U.S. Junior Closed Champion; 
  
> the 2008 U.S. Open Champion; 
  
> the 2009 U.S. State Champion of Champions; 
  
> a total of seven wild card spots, to be determined later. 

I&#8217;m sure this is unrelated, but I wanted to mention that this year&#8217;s U.S. Atomic Wedgie Giving Championship is taking place right down the street at about the same time.  I&#8217;m sure it will be fine.  If you&#8217;ve spent this much time playing chess, like those 24 players,  you must have learned to cut your underwear elastic to lessen the blow right?
