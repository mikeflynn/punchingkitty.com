Holy crap the Rams won a game!

Let me rephrase: _Steve Jackson_ won a game.  The rest of them stood around and took penalties for a few hours.

For those that missed the game, here&#8217;s a recap: There were tons of dropped balls and penalties and, well&#8230;here&#8217;s a clip from the game:
  


Of course there will be those that will spend all day today talking about this being a &#8220;turing point&#8221; and how this was when people took control, but lets cut the crap.  They barely beat the _other_ worst team in the league.  Lets not go crazy on the turning point crap.  Remember the last turing point when they beat the Cowboys last year?  &#8230;oh yeah, that was the last time the Rams <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">one</span> won [_Editor&#8217;s Note: Crap. FAILure is contagious apparently._].
