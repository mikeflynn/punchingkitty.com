He wasn&#8217;t one of those losers to get nothing over the wall&#8230;and he got more than one (well played Chris&#8221;Why Am  I Here?&#8221; Young). In Matty H. just missed the cut to the next round by 2 jacks. Despite his early exit, at least Holliday can hang is hat on having the single longest bomb of the night at 497 feet.

One time we threw a tennis ball all the way over our house.
