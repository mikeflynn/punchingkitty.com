> Court documents say McAfee hit Barnes in the head and on his body with the skillet several times, and that McAfee&#8217;s DNA was found on the handle of the blood-covered skillet that was found next to Barnes&#8217; body.

That sounds like a horrible way to go. No one should ever be killed with a device that&#8217;s main goal is to bring happiness to the world by cooking various forms of pork products. We hear you can also cook other things in skillets, but we don&#8217;t recommend it. Actually, we don&#8217;t recommend killing anyone with it either, but if we had to pick one thing to focus on, it would be the former. We don&#8217;t care what people tell you, no one wants french toast instead of bacon. Only French people probably, but they hardly count.

After the McAfee&#8217;s extradition to St. Louis, he was arraigned and released. Apparently the judge thought that taking a man from Chicago to St. Louis counted as &#8220;time served&#8221;. However the Mayor is petitioning to have him jailed with in the city limits to kick off his &#8220;Every <del>Warm</del> Body Counts!&#8221; campaign for the 2020 Census.
