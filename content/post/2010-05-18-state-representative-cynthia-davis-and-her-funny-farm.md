Cynthia Davis of O&#8217;Fallon. Not like the way girls fall in love with us after a wink and a sip of that drink they should have guarded, but more so in a &#8220;We&#8217;re pretty sure you are nuts and horrible at your job, but we want you to stick around anyway because you&#8217;re nuts and horrible at your job&#8221; kinda way.

There&#8217;s really a lot to digest in those two paragraphs to lets take it slow.

So her daughter decided to raise chickens because she was interested in the environment and agriculture&#8230;ok to us, the max for a agriculturally inclined daughter would be one, maybe two chickens. &#8230;Davis decided 20 was the sweet spot.  Oh and then we find out the daughter is 24. Maybe he should be&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;getting a job instead of raising chickens in the back yard. You like chickens? Go work at KFC.

Also, so glad we got in the &#8220;behind her mother’s Christian bookstore&#8221; in the description of her home. That added a lot to the story. Hey, you forgot to tell us if there was a dog taking a crap outside or if there were any Jesus-shaped oil stains in the parking lot of the Auto-Zone next door.

We&#8217;ll give Davis this though: That sexy little sub-burb farmer knows how to vamp it up for her official headshot though. Rrrrrrrow!  A hot photo like that makes you think: I wondering whats going on down there. Wait, what? Crap already thought about it. ..aaaaannnnnd, now we&#8217;re gay.

_[Editor&#8217;s Note: From the &#8220;tips&#8221; we get on Davis, she probably does think that&#8217;s how people become gay. For the record it&#8217;s not. We&#8217;re pretty sure it happens if a regular guy tries on sparkly jeans on accident.]_
