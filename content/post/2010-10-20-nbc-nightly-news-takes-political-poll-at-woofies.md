Sure to be thrilled with the news are some of our local celebrities got to be national celebrities for a second when you can catch their autographed 8&#215;10 in the background. Take for instance Fox2 anchor Kevin Steincross&#8217; glossy by the door:

Congrats Kevin!

They even included the standard &#8220;I came here to enjoy a hot dog,&#8230;what&#8217;s this? A camera?! I better say something while walking towards it.&#8221; shot:

It&#8217;s all coming together for Overland, Missouri now! We hear NBC has more plans for our little suburb, as shooting should begin on Overland&#8217;s _To Catch a Predator_ episode any day now. &#8230;or maybe we made that up. You don&#8217;t know. Just to be safe, if you head off to any meetings in Overland with a young child, make sure you bring plenty of condoms and Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade. We hear they go easier on you if you bring gifts.

See the actual NBC story with a St. Louis wiener vendor backdrop after the jump!
