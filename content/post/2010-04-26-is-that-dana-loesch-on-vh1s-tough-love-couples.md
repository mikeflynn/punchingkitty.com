No. It&#8217;s not&#8230;but we agree with our tipsters that it totally looks like her though.

On the left is Axelle, who is one of the castmembers on VH1&#8217;s Tough Love Couples show, has a really dumb name, and has a striking resemblance to our own Dana Loesch, who is would certainly qualify as a &#8220;super-fan&#8221; of Punching Kitty.com.

After establishing that, yes, they are in fact two different people, we looked in to how they are alike: After watching the show, we know that **both can be kinda angry** at a moment&#8217;s notice and **both have brown hair**&#8230;um&#8230;we mean on the top of their heads, but we&#8217;re sure what you were thinking is true too.
