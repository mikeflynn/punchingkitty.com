Nothing like two guys that aided in butt-raping the sport of baseball catching up and spreading good cheer via the press.

Barry showed some McGwire love when he (finally) showed up to the 2000 Giants team reunion:

> &#8220;I have a really good friendship with Mark McGwire. I&#8217;m proud of him,&#8221; the 45-year-old Bonds, back in the Bay Area for a reunion at AT&T Park of the Giants&#8217; 2000 NL West champion team, said when asked what he thought of McGwire&#8217;s January admission. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a great relationship throughout our entire lives and throughout our career. I&#8217;m proud of what he did. I&#8217;m happy for him.&#8221;

McGwire heard the news and was all like &#8220;Awwww. That&#8217;s so nice of him. Remember when we used to talk about steroi&#8230;oh right. Still waiting on you to &#8216;come out'&#8221;:

> &#8220;It&#8217;s very cool. Barry is a great player, was a great player in this game, many MVPs,&#8221; McGwire said. &#8220;The guy could do it all. It makes me feel really good. It&#8217;s really cool to be back in the game. &#8230; I&#8217;m a big boy, I understand that things happen in your life and you&#8217;ve got to confront them, and you also have to move on from them and learn from them.&#8221;

Still just waiting on you Barry. You let us know when you want to talk and we&#8217;ll all pretend like we are shocked and fall out of our chairs. We&#8217;re pretty good at it now. &#8220;What?! Rosie O&#8217;DonnellÂ is gay?! Get out.&#8221;, &#8220;Wait. Clark Kent and Superman are the same person!?&#8221;, &#8220;No way! Lindsey Lohan died! Shocked. I&#8217;m shocked.&#8221; (Put this last one in your pocket).

This is great hearing Bonds and Mac talk it up! They should get the whole team back together&#8230;what&#8217;s Sammy Sosa up to these days?

Oh yeah, he retired and shrunk down back to his pre-roids weight where he looked like Carlton from Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
