<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2010/01/18/daily10.html?surround=lfn" target="_blank">According to the St. Louis Business Journal</a>, Fox 2 has decided to send a report to Haiti&#8230;because apparently there isn&#8217;t a single stock photo or video of Haiti around anywhere!  Sadly, its not Rich Gould.

> Fox 2 News’ Roche Madden and cameraman John McClelland have hopped aboard a U.S. Air Force cargo plane at Scott Air Force base headed to Haiti. Madden will be the only St. Louis television reporter reporting from Haiti.

In a related story KSDK plans to send a reporter and a tripod to an Olan Mills photography studio and file reports from in front of the &#8220;_most_ _jungley_&#8221; Senior photo back drop they have.
