People around town have been getting the following email&#8230;

> **From:** Jim Edmonds&#8217; F15teen Steakhouse
> 
> **Subject:** Free Luxury Ride to the Guns N&#8217; Roses Concert

OMG the band that the 80&#8217;s left behind, **Guns &#8216;n Roses** are coming to town! Didn&#8217;t you hear? It must have been huge news considering the last time they took the stage here there was a &#8220;tussle&#8221; of some type (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pomIFCkmHX8" target="_blank">it was kinda big news</a>)! It was everywhere right?! Guns &#8216;n Roses return to St. Louis! Wednesday, November 24th at the Scottrade Center! &#8230;wait wait wait wait wait. We didn&#8217;t hear anything about a Guns &#8216;n Roses concert! No no no! This issn&#8217;t adding up at all. Something smells fishy alright, real fishy, and we aren&#8217;t talking about those well-acted pains Edmonds use to fake in the outfield after a big catch.

Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the email (<a href="http://www.newsletterprofessional.com/preview.php?ID=39461a19e9eddfb385ea76b26521ea48" target="_blank">link</a>):

There _is_ something going on tonight at the Scottrade Center, but it&#8217;s not Guns &#8216;n Roses, it&#8217;s **<a href="http://www.scottradecenter.net/STC-events/gunsnhoses2010.html" target="_blank">Guns &#8216;n </a>**_**<a href="http://www.scottradecenter.net/STC-events/gunsnhoses2010.html" target="_blank">Hoses</a>**._ As in the boxing matches taking place between St. Louis area Police Officers and Firefighters, not the famed band fronted by Axl <strike>Foley</strike> Rose _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Whoops! Though we stand by our Freudian slip of name dropping the far better Axl]_. The part about a fight is pretty close though.

Well, we guess H&#8217;s and R&#8217;s are kinda like each other, in that an R is like a fancy H with its hand by it&#8217;s head and a their left leg kicked out. Seriously though, if this was just a true typo, we wouldn&#8217;t have mentioned it (We&#8230;ahem&#8230;have been know to throw a few typos out ourselves), but upon closer inspection, there&#8217;s not way they can claim typo here. Someone over there thought they were the only ones who knew a Guns &#8216;n Roses concert was going on! &#8220;AVOID THE HIGH-PRICED PARKING DOWNTOWN&#8221; and the frequent use of the word &#8220;concert&#8221; make it pretty clear.

We love our &#8220;boys&#8221; in blue and red for keeping us all safe(-ish), but we don&#8217;t expect the &#8220;Guns &#8216;N Hoses&#8221; boxing event to require you to park out of downtown to avoid the high prices. It would be pretty pimp to be the one guy rolling up to Scottrade in a &#8220;Luxury Limo Bus&#8221; though&#8230;and by &#8220;pimp&#8221; we mean kinda sad. Especially since you&#8217;d be rocking the complementary Axl wig and bandana supplied by F15teen. I mean those things only come by the gross and there aren&#8217;t any returns, so you&#8217;re getting one&#8230;or six&#8230;or 23. You know what? Just take them all and give them to the cops. Maybe they can use them for disguises in meth-house sting operations in Jefferson County.

Thank you for thinking of Jim Edmonds&#8217; F15teen for all your imaginary concert parking and limo service needs!
