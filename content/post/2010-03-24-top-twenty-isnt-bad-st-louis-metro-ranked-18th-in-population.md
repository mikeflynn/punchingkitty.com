Just above Tampa, FL and just below San Diego, CA&#8230;two cities that we would rather be than here.

We thought this would be a good time to celebrate other 18&#8217;s like&#8230;

The 18th President, Ulysses S. Grant

The 18th Amendment, which of course started the prohibition.

The 18th letter of the alphabet: R.  Solid letter.

&#8230;

I was going to make this a list of 18, 18 things, but you know what&#8230;screw that, there&#8217;s porn to be watching.  Maybe I&#8217;ll watch 18 of those&#8230;with 27 year old girls they will say their only 18.  Works out perfectly.
