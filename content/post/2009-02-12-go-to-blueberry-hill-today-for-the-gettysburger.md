Joe Edwards, Loop Godfather and owner of Blueberry Hill has decided to celebrate Abe Lincoln&#8217;s 200th birthday by sticking a flag in to his already amazing burger and call it the Gettysburger! Â For an added touch, the burger also comes with a copy of the Gettysburg Address, because why not right?

We had one earlier today and it was of course great.
