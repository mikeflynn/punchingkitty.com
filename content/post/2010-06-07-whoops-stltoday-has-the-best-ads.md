Found by a reader on STLToday over the weekend:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a rel="attachment wp-att-4842" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/06/07/whoops-stltoday-has-the-best-ads/stltoday_whoops_ad/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4842" title="stltoday_whoops_ad" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/06/stltoday_whoops_ad.jpeg?filter=resize&w=600" alt="" /></a>

  We aren&#8217;t sure at this time if the glue would have helped keep the swing together better or if STLToday is suggesting we actually put the child back together with Elmers.
