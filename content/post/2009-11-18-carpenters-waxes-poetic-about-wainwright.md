It appears as the ink wasn&#8217;t totally wasted though, as our favorite local Cardinals blog <a href="http://www.vivaelbirdos.com" target="_blank">Viva El Birdos</a> got a little something awesome in their email&#8230;

I won&#8217;t reprint the whole thing as you can go to <a href="http://www.vivaelbirdos.com/2009/11/17/1161475/waino-the-cy-young-and-me-a-poem" target="_blank">the VEB post</a> to check it out, but here&#8217;s a little taste:

Powerful. Stupid. But he done sure throw stuff good!

&#8230;plus its going to really be awkward when Tim Lincecum wins.
