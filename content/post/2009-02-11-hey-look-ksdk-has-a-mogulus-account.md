That is apparently channel 5, ksdk&#8217;s Mogulus account.  What is Mogulus?  Its a service for streaming live video to the web.

Anyone have any idea what they are doing with this?  There&#8217;s lots of great things they could do with a Mogulus account _[Ed Note: I&#8217;m being serious.]_ but their track record says they aren&#8217;t using it to the fullest, or at all.
