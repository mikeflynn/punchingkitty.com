> The theft happened over the weekend. Nearly 30 figures were painted and added to the display. Kindergartners dedicated parts of this to honor someone special. All that&#8217;s left are the figures surrounding what used to be a nativity scene.

Ok, so this was probably done by the Jews right? Clearly they hate Jesus, taking out &#8220;original&#8221; Jesus a few thousand years back, and now they are going after plywood baby Jesus! Well look, it had to have been the Jews _or_ St. Louis is the kind of town that steals cutouts of the three wisemen, hand-painted by kindergarteners adored with tokens that remind the kids of the special people in their life. You tell us what is more likely&#8230;yeah we know. It&#8217;s the second option. We&#8217;re horrible people in the city, but you&#8217;ve got to come to us for **Gus&#8217; Pretzels**. That&#8217;s the deal.

> &#8220;If it was a prank, I&#8217;d just like tomorrow morning maybe they could just be leaning up against the side of the school or stick them in the bushes, or leave them back,&#8221; Cooney said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for arresting anyone, we&#8217;d just like to see them back.&#8221;

Fox2&#8217;s Dave Murray is reporting that tomorrow&#8217;s weather will have a pleasant warm up until the temperature reaches &#8220;fire&#8221;-type levels around noon, followed by scattered brimstone lasting until at least the beginning of rush hour.
