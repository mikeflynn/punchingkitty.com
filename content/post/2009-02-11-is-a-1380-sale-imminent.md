There is word that there has been a complete hiring freeze at Simmons owned stations (thats 1380AM and 1490AM here in St. Louis) because of a possible up coming sale of all properties in Texas and Missouri.

Its no secret 1380 is in serious trouble after the recent firings that left only one person on the business side for the entire station, but we aren&#8217;t sure about the heresy of a full station sale.  We tend to think there would be more word out if something like that was really this close to happening, and of course there is the question of &#8220;Who the hell would buy 1380?&#8221; still hanging out there.

If we hear more, of course we will pass it on to you, our sexy readers.
