Kids at an East St. Louis school had the best school lunch ever Wednesday when the school was forced to order 100 pizzas when a sewer line backed up in the cafeteria.

Good for them for knowing the difference between the usual school lunch and _actual_ sewage (the difference is a side of fries)

> East St. Louis Senior High School assistant superintendent Beth Shepperd said someone working in the lunch room noticed raw sewage seeping into the food preparation area about 45 minutes before lunch time.
> 
> Officials said lunch was delayed about an hour, but all students were fed by 1:30 p.m.

A grease trap is being labeled as the issue. It apparently was full and never emptied, dried and shredded for Friday&#8217;s &#8220;square pizza&#8221; day.

> Crews fixed the sewage problem and the school’s cafeteria was operating as normal.

Yes, that&#8217;s the normal smell.
