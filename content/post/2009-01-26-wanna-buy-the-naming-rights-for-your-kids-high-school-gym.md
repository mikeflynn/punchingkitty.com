Thats the question that a lot of local schools are asking and others are asking if its kosher to sell the naming rights of a school building like we do stadiums and hospital buildings.  

From [The Post Dispatch&#8217;s recent article][1] on the subject:

> &#8230;school districts still worry that they need to lay out guidelines so they&#8217;re not caught unprepared for potentially inappropriate naming requests.
> 
> Those concerns have, in part, prompted at least seven area school districts to pass or revise policies in the past year that define the limits and specifics of naming rights. 
> 
> &#8220;We&#8217;re all at the point where this is something you&#8217;ll have to deal with,&#8221; said Mary Jane Driscoll, in charge of development and alumni relations for the Lindbergh School District. &#8220;When somebody&#8217;s standing there with the check, you don&#8217;t want to be standing there going, &#8216;Uh, duh, uh&#8230;'&#8221;

So when presented with a check from a company trying to buy naming rights to a school building you would respond like you, yourself were brought up in a St. Louis public school.  Awesome.

We at PunchingKitty know times are tough for schools and they are run by people that aren&#8217;t exactly all that bright, so we&#8217;ve decided to help with this easy guide&#8230;

Do name your buildings:

  * The Gus&#8217; Pretzels Cafeteria
  * The Stan Musial Four Square Area
  * Mike Shannon&#8217;s Language Center

Do **not** name your buildings:

  * The InBev Back Parking Lot Where No One Will See You Drink
  * The Ike Turner Teen Counseling Center 
  * The Casino Queen Girls Locker Room: Home of the Loosest Slots Around!
  * The Lee&#8217;s Pawn Shop Administration Building
