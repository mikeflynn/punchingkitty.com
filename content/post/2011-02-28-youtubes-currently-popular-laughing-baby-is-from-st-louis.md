Another day, another &#8220;viral&#8221; laughing baby video on YouTube. The current baby is laughing because his dad ripped some paper in front of him (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXXm696UbKY" target="_blank">again</a>) and he&#8217;s from St. Louis.

> [Father, Marcus McArthur] says he&#8217;s finishing up his doctorate at SLU and applying for professor jobs.  When he received yet another rejection letter he ripped it in half and baby Micah started laughing uncontrollably, so he started ripping credit card statements and the sweet sounds of laughter continued.

&#8230;so they uploaded it to YouTube and then it happened: **Alyssa Milano** <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Alyssa_Milano/status/41191428877058048" target="_blank">tweeted it</a>! After that it was &#8220;viral&#8221;, proving, at last, who the boss is.
