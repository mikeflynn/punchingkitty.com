The controversial web mash-up of the public list of donors to California&#8217;s Proposition 8 law and a map of California and the country, [eightmaps.com][1], reveals the shocking number of _zero_ for the St. Louis area.

Yup, zero.  According to the site, no one from the St. Louis area gave any money to Prop 8.  Sure it was a law in California, but you would be surprised at the far reaches of their donor list and yet not a soul from St. Louis.

We here at Punching Kitty are surprised and though still pissed that Prop 8 passed (it really ruined our election night!) its nice to see St. Louis didn&#8217;t help&#8230;monetarily at least.
