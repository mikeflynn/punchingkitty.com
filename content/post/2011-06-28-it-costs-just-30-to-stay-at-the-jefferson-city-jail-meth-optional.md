What a deal! &#8230;right? Hmm&#8230;it sounds interesting, but something isn&#8217;t quite sitting right with us here&#8230;

> The newest place to stay in downtown Jefferson City opens for business next month, and the management is offering a grand-opening special: $30 for a one-night stay with dinner, breakfast and your own private cell. Every guest will get a free booking photo and a complimentary &#8220;Cole County Jail&#8221; T-shirt.

Don&#8217;t you see what&#8217;s going on here?! Can&#8217;t you see their plan?! Cheap room and board with &#8220;complimentary&#8221; clothes?! Jefferson City residents far and wide won&#8217;t be able to pass up the cheap thrills of &#8220;seein&#8217; what it was like for Uncle Jesse, or Aunt Clem in the pokey!&#8221; so they file in, sign up, suit up and get locked in to their &#8220;room&#8221;&#8230;and that&#8217;s when the warden comes out: &#8220;Attention folks! This here is the new jail &#8217;round these parts and we just hated to see her empty like this so we invited you nice folks in for a stay. [Laughter] &#8230;but here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;we&#8217;re in Jefferson City, which is situated right there in the middle of meth country so chances are, at least 63% of you here tonight are either carrying meth or are high right now. Sure 60/40 isn&#8217;t an ideal ratio for mass incarserations such as this, but all in all we&#8217;re happy with those numbers.&#8221;
