<a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Man-shot-in-buttocks-listed-in-serious-but-stable-condition-85767482.html" target="_blank">KMOV is reporting</a> a man was shot in the butt Saturday night in north St. Louis.  I know.  Totally surprising.

> According to police, the victim and three friends were walking across the street when a newer model dark blue or black SUV approached.
> 
> The front seat passenger got out and fired shots; the victim and friends ran to a nearby residence. The suspects fled the scene.

The victim is in stable, but totally embarrassed condition because there&#8217;s no way to make an ass wound sound badass.

They are stopping the car now so the shooter can get out? Is the full-fledged &#8220;drive by&#8221; no longer cool?  I can&#8217;t tell if this is lazy for making aiming less of a challenge or taking more pride in their work by wanting to make sure they hit something other than innocent kids or old cops 2 days from retirement.
