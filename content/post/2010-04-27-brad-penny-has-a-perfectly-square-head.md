That is one square head and neck combo is it not?

Is that attractive? Do girls like heads that look like a tree stump with ears glued on the side? Is this what you want? <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/?attachment_id=4090" target="_blank">Eliza Dushku</a>, [Alyssa Milano][2], and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/27/brad-pennys-girlfriend-is-straight-bangin-yo/" target="_blank">whoever the hell this chick is</a> apparently all think so as Penny has dipped in to each of their pine tar at one point or another.

We&#8217;re confused. Â I mean the guy&#8217;s pitching his ass off so far, so really as long as he keeps winning, we&#8217;re cool, but its hard to believe a guy that looks like his head was formed by pushing playdough through the square hole on the spaghetti maker is able to pull tail as good as the list above.
