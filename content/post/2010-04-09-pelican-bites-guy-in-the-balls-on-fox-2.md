Oh you wacky morning shows where you leave the studio for the craziness of the hallway.  Wait a minute! Birds aren&#8217;t supposed to be out here!



Right in the balls. Always funny. Thank God the bird went over that guy though and didn&#8217;t decide to tug on anything below the belt on Randi Naughton. That would have just been awkward and then embarrassing in a very weird way for John Pertzborn.
