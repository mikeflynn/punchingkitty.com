According to [STLMedia.net][1], heads might be rolling at KSDK after Gannett tried and failed to force a week long, un-paid, vacation for its employees.  The word is, the lay offs could come as soon as next week.  

If &#8220;famous&#8221; heads are getting lopped off from media companies, couldn&#8217;t we at least turn this in to some fun for someone?  What if KSDK said, Survivor style, that the following people were up for &#8220;elimination&#8221; and then we get the vote to see who gets the axe?!  

Cruel?  Maybe&#8230;  Would you still partake?  You know you would!  &#8230;oh and more importantly&#8230;their sales staff could get the poll sponsored!

Here&#8217;s who I&#8217;m nominating to go in to the &#8220;KSDK Inferno&#8221;:

Mike Owens:

Not that I have any proof, but he just seems like he&#8217;s a giant dick off the air.

Sharon Stevens:

I&#8217;m really doing this for you Sharon&#8230;you have _got_ to be tired of doing weekend-night shift updates!

Casey Nolen:

I&#8217;ve never seen this dude before in my life.  What I&#8217;m saying is axing him is the safe approach, like the Klingons taking out &#8220;Ensign Ricky&#8221; on Star Trek. 

 

I&#8217;ll take your votes, thoughts, suggestions, your own lists, or reason&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a monster (probably from Casey Nolen&#8217;s mom) in the comments.
