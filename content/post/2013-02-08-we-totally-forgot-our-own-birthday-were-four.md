So it was our birthday on January 14th. We forgot. We turned four years old then, but now we&#8217;re like four and three quarters or something, and what does that get you? Not much it would seem. We still have a ways to go before that first drink, but we can get our ears pierced and then have everyone in the mall look at us and our parents with distain on our way to the car.

<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/01/16/punching-kitty-turns-three-and-launches-new-redesign/" target="_blank">Last year on our birthday we gave you a new awesome redesign</a>, but we didn&#8217;t this year because we still like this design. However, we do have something for you: Easter eggs aka weird features of the site that have been there forever and none of you knew it. There&#8217;s a bunch, but since no one has figured them out, here&#8217;s one everyone can try: &#8220;slay&#8221; Just click on any part of our page that isn&#8217;t a link to make sure your browser is in focus and then type the word &#8220;slay&#8221;, which you no doubt have figured out that it&#8217;s a tribute to one of our favorite targets on the site. Have fun trying to figure out the rest of them!

Also we noticed you guys didn&#8217;t exactly get us anything. Thanks so much (dick)!
