Willie Jones was throwing out the trash when he heard noises coming from a trash bag by the dumpster. We would have screamed like a girl, ran in to the house only to come out later with a broom and a chair to stand on while poking the bag. Willie just checked what was inside, which would have been our second choice.

Mystery solved: A human probably put them in the bag. Cartoon dogs will some times do tricks to cats like this sort of thing, but they usually don&#8217;t bother to place the bag by a dumpster. They usually tie the bag to a rocket, which ends up just really tied to their leg after one of the cats figures out the plot and reties it. &#8230;or maybe the fuse somehow blows the dog up giving him that exploded black face&#8230;we&#8217;re getting off track here, but regardless, our guess is a human asshole put the cats there.

> Jones tried several numbers before he was put in contact with Tenth Life Cat Rescue, a group that places rescued cats in foster homes, then adopts them out. Someone from Tenth Life picked the kittens up Sunday afternoon.
> 
> Elizabeth Frick, who started the organization in 2009,Â praised Jones for his actions.

Good to see everything is going to be fine for our little furry friends!

> &#8220;What a good man,&#8221; said Frick, **who runs Tenth Life from her home**. &#8220;We are very grateful to him.&#8221;

He gave them to a lady that collects cats to adopt out of her home?! Hmm, ok. &#8220;Now that we have these five new cats here, we can chose some of our older, less attractive cats to be carefully placed in to a trash bag and set by the dumpster.&#8221; Frick (probably) said later.
