It would seem its &#8220;horrible parents&#8221; week here at Punching Kitty. Yesterday we told you about <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/09/04/mother-of-the-year-krystal-rushing-of-rosewood-heights-il/" target="_blank">a woman who lets her one kid escape and then leaves the other one alone when she goes to look for the first one</a>, and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/09/04/the-best-way-to-keep-your-car-from-being-stolen-is-to-leave-your-child-in-there/" target="_blank">a dad that got his car stolen after leaving it running with his 5 year old in the back</a>. Now those are pretty horrible stories, but today&#8217;s story might be even better&#8230;err worse&#8230;well better, but in a comedic sense&#8230;not comedic per se, maybe like &#8220;better&#8221; in an OMG WTF kinda way.

KMOV described the situation thusly (emphasis ours):

> A Springfield man is behind bars in Manchester for driving while intoxicated. However, Jason Turnbough wasn’t alone- **he had his four children in the car with him**.
> 
> Turnbough, 37, was charged Aug. 20 for DWI, endangering children and driving while his license was revoked. The oldest child was 11 years old; the youngest was one year old. Turnbough was also charged as a chronic offender.

Jason Turnbough has had four previous DWI, his license was revoked, but guess what? Turns out dudes that have four DWIs, tend to not give a shit about rules and stuff. Crazy right? They took his little piece of laminated paper with his picture on it, but yet he still managed to find a car! How did he know how to turn it out without his license?! This bastard is one keen criminal mastermind. At least we know the system isn&#8217;t to blame. No one could have known that he&#8217;d flagrantly flaunt the law with his amazing &#8220;driving without a license&#8221; ability&#8230;_five freaking times_!

> Upon pulling him over officers noticed Turnbough had slurred speech, bloodshot and glassy eyes, and a strong odor of alchohol on his breath. According to court documents, he also failed a field sobriety test and refused a breathalyzer test.

So drunk he was slurring his speech while driving his 4 children around? Nice job buddy. We&#8217;ll give you this though: It&#8217;s nice to get the family together on major life milestones. Usually we&#8217;re talking about things like getting a promotion, or finishing a marathon, but &#8220;5th DWI&#8221; might be a big deal for some Missouri folk, so&#8230;congratulations Jason! Your kid&#8217;s foster parents and their eventual cellmates are really going to love hearing about Dad&#8217;s &#8220;Quest for #5!&#8221; at the bar that day.
