> The case is #09JE-CR00165-01 “The State vs Ryan A. Huff” and will be heard by Judge Mark T Stoll.  There is a pre-trial set for November 13, 2009, with the actual jury trial starting on November 30th, 2009.

&#8230;so its no wonder we started getting emails this last week for updates on this case since it appears that the wheels were finally in motion.

Not so fast.

After doing some quick research in to the case it appears things have been delayed a bit.  There is now a Plea Hearing set for **March 10th, 2010** and that is the only thing scheduled for this case at the time of this writing.

As always, we&#8217;ll keep you updated when we know more.

Until then you can catch up on all the <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/ryan-huff/" target="_blank">past Ryan Huff posts</a>.
