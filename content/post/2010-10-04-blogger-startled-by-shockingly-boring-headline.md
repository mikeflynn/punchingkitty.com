Real headline from KMOV. While we keep looking for &#8220;Woman Burns Hand on Hot Plate After Waiter Told Her It Was Hot&#8221; you check out Mr. Block Quote:

> Belleville Police were called to the 500 block of North 40<sup>th</sup> Street just after 8 a.m.   The resident told police she was sitting in her living room when she heard a noise coming from her bedroom.
> 
> When she went to investigate she found the window open and a person standing just outside.
> 
> The woman told police the person fled when she screamed.

Ok, that&#8217;s a little creepy with a man peaking in to an empty room. What else happened? Have a knife? Gun? Wang hanging out?

> No further details on the matter were released.

&#8230;

So nothing else? She saw a guy by her window and called the cops&#8230; There have been a bank robbery every day for a month it seems like and yet this is news? It&#8217;s like the Wild West but with more reports of pervy teachers and preists than I remember reading about in history books these days and KMOV is going with &#8220;Woman Startled by Person Outside Her Window&#8221;?

Maybe this is a story, but it would have to have been Steve Buscemi outside the window. Then it&#8217;s news and also really really scary&#8230;and then pretty awesome actually.
