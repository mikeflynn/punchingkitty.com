&#8230;and yeah, this (alleged) child molester&#8217;s name is Finger. Also, that picture on the right isn&#8217;t a sketch we made of what the classic molester guy looks like, that&#8217;s Mr. Finger himself. &#8230;oh and one more little thing:

> Prosecutors said Finger had a prior sex offense in Tennessee but had not registered as a sex offender in Missouri despite living here for about four years.

How did a guy with priors, who looks like that, and has a name of &#8220;Finger&#8221; get anywhere near a child in this day and age? It seems like you can&#8217;t help a crying child any more out of fear of people accusing you of being a pedophile, but this guy, with an intact perv mustache, is picking off kids in O&#8217;Fallon with no problem?! We know the whole &#8220;don&#8217;t just a book by it&#8217;s cover&#8221; deal, but in this case it seems like a reasonable assumption.

If you&#8217;re wondering why a man with Bob&#8217;s predilections didn&#8217;t file the paperwork to change his name to something a little less suggestive, he did actually. His name _used_ to be Robert Childrape. We&#8217;re pretty sure it&#8217;s a German name.
