**Rick Ankiel:** Hey!  How have you been?

**SB:** Uh, good.  Who&#8217;s this?

**RA:** Ha!  Yeah&#8230;so haven&#8217;t heard from you in a while.

**SB:** I know&#8230;I&#8217;ve been busy.  Seriously, who is this?

**RA:** Rick!  Rick Ankiel.

**SB:** Oh yeah!  Sorry&#8230;you know&#8230;bad connection.  How&#8217;s the old pitching arm kid?!

**RA:** Scott, remember?  I&#8217;m an outfielder now.

**SB:** &#8230;oh yeah. Real shame about that.

**RA:** Yeah, so anyway&#8230;great job with Matt Holliday by the way.

**SB:** Thanks! We really came out great on that one.  Really great deal.  When you get to free agency, hopefully you can get a deal yourself.

**SB:** Oh.  Call your agen&#8230;

**RA:** You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> my agent!

**SB:** Oh.

**RA:** Think I can get back with the Cardinals?

**SB:** No, I think I already took their money&#8230;er&#8230;I mean with Holliday&#8230;

**RA:** Yeah&#8230;Yankees?

**SB:** Maybe I&#8217;ll give them a call&#8230;or&#8230;well&#8230;

**RA:** What?

**SB:** Piratesayswhat?

**RA:** What?!

**SB:** Great. You&#8217;ll love Pittsburgh.  I hear the Steelers were good last year. &#8230;

**RA:** The Pirates?! Dude!

**SB:** Yup, turns out that was legally binding.

**RA:** But I hate Pittsburgh!

**SB:** Well seeing as how you rarely leave Spring Training, I don&#8217;t think that should be a problem.
