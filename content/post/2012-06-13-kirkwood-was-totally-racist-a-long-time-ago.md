Newsflash: Everyone was really really racist a while back. We know, you&#8217;re totally shocked. Who would have thought the residents of an area that was worked by slaves would be racist, but it&#8217;s true. Here&#8217;s the proof:

> A viewer alerted News 4 of an old covenant in the Osage Hills neighborhood. After an investigation, it was revealed that a 1926 agreement between the original neighbors blocked certain races from occupying homes.
> 
> “No building shall at any time be occupied by negroes or malays, except in capacity of bona fide servants or employees,” the covenant read.

Yup, that&#8217;s horrible, but it&#8217;s really not an issue now because we all know that&#8217;s horrible and it&#8217;s an unenforceable law since the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Normally, you&#8217;d just get rid of the law, or if it&#8217;s some crazy thing that you can&#8217;t remove for some reason, then you just do one of those &#8220;Wow, can you imagine?!&#8221; conversations, take a picture for the history books, and forget about it because it really doesn&#8217;t matter nowadays&#8230;but we&#8217;re talking about Kirkwood and these people need something to do with their time, so here we go!

> “You have different races that live in this neighborhood. Absolutely,” she said. “We have a multi-racial family that lives right there, another family right up the street. And they’re all friends, they’re friends of ours. We have block parties. It’s just not an issue.”

&#8220;&#8230;so, ok. It&#8217;s just the two black families really&#8230;and we just have the block parties so that they can set the table and we count that as enough &#8216;service&#8217; to abide by the old bylaws. We don&#8217;t want to break the neighborhood rules, but we don&#8217;t want to be sticklers or anything. For instance, we also all go to them if anyone is out of sugar. It&#8217;s just little things we can do to make sure we&#8217;re ok legally.&#8221; she (probably) continued.

> “The city has no control over it, it’s an agreement written by the original homeowners when they established the subdivision,” said Kirkwood spokeswoman Beth Von Behren,
> 
> “It does get people’s attention and it is ridiculous.  Both state and federal law anti-discrimination laws overrule it in any event,” said Von Behren. “The neighborhood has been trying to change the covenant for years.”

A law you don&#8217;t enforce is pretty much meaningless, so unless you&#8217;re being a super dick about the &#8220;rules&#8221; the law is basically nullified by default. For instance, <a href="http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/missouri" target="_blank">according to dumblaws.com</a>, it is illegal to have oral sex in the state of Missouri, and it&#8217;s illegal to sit on the curb of a St. Louis city street and drink from a bucket, but we&#8217;re guessing you could drink from a bucket without issue if you wanted to, and we&#8217;re not in jail now, so that other thing must not really be illegal either! High five! You know what we&#8217;re talking about! &#8230;blow jobs. We just wanted to be clear, we were referring to our earlier law about oral sex. Now for sure you know what we&#8217;re talking about!! Woo!

> Still, residents feel it could be worth the hassle [to change the covenant]. With the covenant on paper, meaningless as it is, there’s still a cloud over a peaceful neighborhood.

It&#8217;s an issue because you&#8217;re making it an issue. If you want to make a big deal about something stupid from the past, your time would be better spent trying to tell that TV Land cable channel to stop creating <a href="http://www.tvland.com/shows" target="_blank">new horrible shows featuring old washed up sitcom actors</a> and get back to airing some &#8220;Who&#8217;s the Boss&#8221; up in this bitch!
