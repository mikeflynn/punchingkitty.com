The lesson? Always be true to yourself.

> Patty Bigbee, 45, and her boyfriend Lawrence Works, 42, were arrested last Friday in Daytona Beach and charged with illegal sale or surrender of a child, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. Bigbee was also charged with communication fraud.
> 
> But in June 2008, Bigbee was being celebrated for winning a $1 million Powerball jackpot.  She is quoted on the Missouri Lottery&#8217;s website as saying she planned &#8220;to use her winnings to buy a house, a car, share with her friends and family and treat her cat, Black, &#8216;like royalty.'&#8221;

So what does one do when you blow through a Million dollars in two years? You look around your house and see what you can sell. Chair? No, we like that chair. You know we never use that bocce ball set anymore&#8230;oh right, 4th of July BBQ. Good times. Is there nothing around here that we don&#8217;t want because it won&#8217;t stop pooping and gets all whiney when it doesn&#8217;t get its twice-weekly feeding? &#8230;wait a minute. Hey Stephanie! Is it cool if we sell your baby?!

> In a new development in the case today, Bigbee&#8217;s daughter and the child&#8217;s biological mother, Stephanie Bigbee Fleming, 22, of Bradenton, Fla., was charged with being a principal to illegal sale or surrender of a child, according to the Florida Department of Law enforcement.
> 
> Fleming allegedly knew about her mother&#8217;s attempt to sell her then 8-week-old son and wanted some of the money to pay for a new car, authorities say.

Stephanie said it was cool.

The question is, of course, how much does a baby cost these days? Oh we know&#8230;you&#8217;re just &#8220;curious&#8221;. \*wink\*

> [Agents] arrested Bigbee last week after she attempted to sell the child to a couple for $75,000. They said the price was negotiated down to $30,000.

She got talked down from $75k to $30k?! The whole &#8220;blow through a Million bucks in a year&#8221; story is starting to come in to focus. Gotta stay firm at $50 grand for a mint condition baby, but maybe Bigbee was just looking to close the deal after wasting previous baby-selling opportunities: The last baby Bigbee had she just gave away like a chump!

> The informant was Bigbee&#8217;s biological daughter, whom she had given up for adoption 26 years ago, Murphy said. An affidavit said Bigbee and Danielle Skiver, 27, had found each other on Facebook in July and were communicating.
> 
> When Skiver told her mother she wanted a baby, Bigbee offered her grandson for sale, according to the documents. Skiver then notified authorities.

Facebook: Reconnecting you with people that you wish you wouldn&#8217;t have reconnected with and then tried to sell you a baby, which for a second you thought about because you haggled them down $45 grand and then said, never mind, maybe we should just call the cops.
