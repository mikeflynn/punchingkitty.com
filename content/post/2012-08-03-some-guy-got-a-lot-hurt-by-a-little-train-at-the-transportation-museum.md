No museum puts you right in the middle of the subject matter like the St. Louis Museum of Transportation! Yesterday, they even had a real life train wreck!Â It&#8217;s all part of their &#8220;Summer of Horrible Transportation Stuff&#8221; program!

> An employee at the downtown [sic] transportation museum was injured after being struck by a miniature train on Thursday.
> 
> Officials said the man was working on the train tracks at the Museum of Transportation in the 2900 block of Barrett Station when he was struck by a train that takes visitors on a tour of the grounds.

He&#8217;s ok after suffering injuries to his leg and foot, and most importantly, he finally really understands what irony is, so it all ended up for the best.

Swing by the Transportation Museum next week when they plan to set up a mini Metrolink and allow you to sit on it while a smelly homeless guy, a guy with a non-stop terrible cough, an old lady from St. Charles who is super nervous to be on the Metrolink, and one of those people that for some reason has to bring their bicycle on board at the next stop and chose to squish in around you.
