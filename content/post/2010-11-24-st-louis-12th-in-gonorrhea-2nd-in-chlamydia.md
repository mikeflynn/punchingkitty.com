St. Louis dropped from the #1 Gonorrhea city to the 12th in the recently released federal statistics, but held firm on to the silver medal for Chlamydia.

> Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention releases data on the three sexually transmitted diseases — chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis — that physicians are required to report. St. Louis has consistently ranked in the top five in gonorrhea and chlamydia infection rates over the last decade, reaching the top spot in both diseases three years ago and second place last year.
> 
> The latest numbers show that reported cases of gonorrhea in the city dropped from 1,890 cases in 2008 to 1,296 cases in 2009. That number is 55 percent lower than just four years ago, when there were 2,828 cases, according to the St. Louis Department of Health.

You know what? Hell yeah! We&#8217;ll take a win when we can get it! The cause for such a drop is hard to pin down, but theories such as better education and more readily available testing and treatment are being given the credit. Our theory is that in the last year we, as a city, have started a united effort to stop jamming our dicks in to each other and instead use knives and or bullets.

> Untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women, which can result in infertility. Some studies suggest that people with STDs are also at increased risk for HIV.

&#8230;especially if one of your STDs is HIV.

Well St. Louis we still need to work on that Chlamydia rating, but go ahead and pat yourselves on the back for getting your raging gonorrhea slightly more under control. Wear gloves though.
