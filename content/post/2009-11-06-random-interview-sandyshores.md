One [@SandyShores][2] What?  Oh, that&#8217;s her Twitter name.  I thought it was odd at first too that someone would name their child something that started with @, but I figured it was just foreign like that Russian O with a line through it.  Then a &#8220;social media expert&#8221; told me it was a Twitter thing.  I tried to get more information from him, but he started to walk off and I was like &#8220;Oh you have to get to work?&#8221; and he said &#8220;Work?!  I&#8217;m a social media expert.  Its just what you call telemarketers online.&#8221;  So that solves that mystery.

Anyways&#8230;

**Punching Kitty:** _Who are you?_

> I am a workaholic who somehow finds time to do 10,000+ tweets in 18 months; a short gal with more hair than should be allowed for someone my size; a grammar nazi.

**PK:** _What do you do?_

> I am in sales.  Yup- a sales whore.  We also own a pizza pace- which makes question #4 a no-brainer for me!

**PK:** _How&#8217;s it going?_

> Chillin&#8217; like a villian.  My life kicks ass.  Great friends.  Good job.  My family is healthy.  And I have a great man who loves me.  What else could a gal want??

**PK:** _Best non-national-chain pizza not named Imo&#8217;s in St. Louis?_

> Papa Murphy&#8217;s Take N Bake Pizza in Wildwood.  (Shamelsss self-promotion, but accurate!)

**PK:** _You think the Rams will win a game this year or do you not even care?_

> I&#8217;m from LA and the Rams were the LA reject team.  Are we gonna get the Clippers next?  So yeah- my answer?  Don&#8217;t care.

**PK:** _What&#8217;s the worst thing about St. Louis?_

> The humidity kills my dad&#8217;s sinuses.  That&#8217;s the only thing preventing him from moving back here.  Being a total daddy&#8217;s girl, I want my dad here.  Thus- I&#8217;d like to get rid of the humidity and make that possible.

**PK:** _Who is the biggest St. Louis celeb have you met? What&#8217;s the story?_

> Ozzie Smith.  The story?  It&#8217;s an embarassing one.  When I first moved here in 1992 from Santa Barbara, I turned on the radio (KSD, classic rock) and heard that Ozzy was going to be at Keiner Plaza.  I found my way downtown expecting to see Ozzy and instead saw a bunch of Cardinals fans.  Where was Ozzy??  I asked about 100 people where Ozzy was.  Finally a guy taps me on the shoulder and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m Ozzie&#8221;.  I looked at him and said &#8220;bullshit&#8221; because he was obviously NOT Ozzy.  Apparently there was a famous guy here named Ozzie&#8230;not Ozzy.

**PK:** _What&#8217;s the most annoying guy first name?_

> Rush.  Tied with Phil (as in Dr Phil)

**PK:** _The correct answer there was Keith.  Keith.  Close though_.

**PK:** _Think of your own question, ask it to yourself and then answer it._

> What&#8217;s the square root of 111707?  334.226
