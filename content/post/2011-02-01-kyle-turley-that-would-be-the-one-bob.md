[<img class="size-full wp-image-8765 alignright" title="turley_otl_3_the_dude" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/01/turley_otl_3_the_dude.jpg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]A recent Washington University School of Medicine study discussed the use, or rather misuse, of painkillers by current and former NFL players. The study, commissioned by <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=110128/PainkillersNews" target="_blank">ESPN&#8217;s Outside the Lines</a>, found that 52 percent of former players used prescription pain meds during their active days, and 15 percent of that group admitted to misusing drugs in the last month.

> &#8220;That&#8217;s a very large number in a population that, at that age, we wouldn&#8217;t expect to see much use of these substances at all,&#8221; Compton said. &#8220;Most typical 30- and 40-year olds aren&#8217;t taking pain relievers, and they&#8217;re not misusing them, so that&#8217;s a much higher than expected rate.&#8221;

One of the study&#8217;s main sources of antidotal information was friend-of-the-site, former Ram and Chief, and master of the homeless guy chic look, Kyle Turley:

> Turley said it was commonplace to find comfort in the form of two Miller Lites. But the real relief, Turley said, would come when members of the Saints&#8217; medical staff routinely handed out the prescription painkiller Vicodin on the flights home.
> 
> &#8220;The trainers and the doctors used to go down the aisle and say, &#8216;Who needs what?'&#8221; Turley said. &#8220;If you had something hurting and needed a painkiller to take the edge off so you could sleep that night, they made sure you had it.&#8221;

Turley was interviewed on the ESPN Outside the Lines program Sunday morning by Bob Ley. When the questioning turned to Turley&#8217;s current method of self-medication, things got awesome: (The clip has been transcribed below, but if you&#8217;re at home skipping work because you&#8217;re afraid of the snow, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agsjqHiZAzM  " target="_blank">click here to see the clip</a>.)

> **Ley**: Is it fair to say that at times or how often you may have used more than prescribed than over the counter medication?
> 
> **Turley**: I try to keep things personally more on the&#8230;uh&#8230;alternative medical thing. I don&#8217;t really believe in all these pain killers they prescribe people. It&#8217;s unfortunate we allow these doctors to create these chemicals and put (them) in our bodies and yet a simple thing like a plant that grows out of the ground is continuing to be illegal when it provieds a number of medical uses and relief for individuals pain and all kinds of other ailments&#8230;and, you know, I try to think that life can be better as long as I take care of myself and allow nature to help me&#8230;
> 
> **Ley**: Can I assume&#8230;the plant you&#8217;re referring to is&#8230;is cannabis right?
> 
> **Turley**: &#8230;uh yes. That would be the one Bob.

Oddly, Kyle was red-eyed in front of a gold curtain for the entire interview. Only after the cameras were turned off did we get a peak and what was back there&#8230;
