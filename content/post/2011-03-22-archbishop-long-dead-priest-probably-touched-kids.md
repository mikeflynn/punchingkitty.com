In the meantime, he served as a priest in southern Missouri as well as St. Charles County, and, according to St. Louis Archbishop Robert Carlson, he touched kids. Rebuttal Father Wieberg? &#8230;oh, that&#8217;s right, you&#8217;re dead.

> Five people have come forward over the past few years alleging abuse that happened from the mid-1940s through the early 1960s, Phil Hengen, director of the archdiocesan office of Child and Youth Protection, said Monday. The archdiocesan Review Board also heard from relatives of a sixth person. The board deemed the allegations credible.

They better be credible, because getting your ass called out as a molester nearly 50 years after you died would suck butt (consenting adult butt of course) if you didn&#8217;t really do any of that. We must say though, it is rather good to see even just a section of the Catholic Church take this issue on, stand up and deal with it. Even if it is pertaining to a long since dead priest, maybe these people can move on easier with it out in the open.

&#8230;or&#8230;and we&#8217;re just spit-balling here&#8230;this is a new brillant move by the St. Louis Archdiocese. Think about it: Coming forward, admitting wrong&#8230;and blaming it on a guy that died 50 years ago! Damn that&#8217;s brilliant. Next steps in the healing process will be the piling on Father Wieberg by naming him as the cause of the following other foibles by the Catholic Church: Ignoring the Holocaust: &#8220;We wanted to talk discuss and condem it, but Wieberg was all like &#8216;Hell no! Lets just stay here and ignore that crap and focus on why we can&#8217;t ever find any good chinese here in Missouri.&#8221; or whatever it was that the _Da Vinci Code_ said the church did: &#8220;Wieberg was totally down for covering all that stuff up. Oh, and the whole &#8216;Lets get a creepy albino guy to kill people and whip himself.&#8217; deal? Totally Wieberg&#8217;s idea. Thought it would be hilarious. His first idea was a midget, but it didn&#8217;t work out logistically. He kept whipping the floor behind him instead of his back, and it was harder for him to kill people. Bruised a lot of shins though.&#8221;
