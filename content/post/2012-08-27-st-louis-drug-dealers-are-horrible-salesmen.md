Ok, well we give up! It&#8217;s officially a no-win situation in St. Louis when someone walks up to you at a probably creepy North City gas station as asks if you want to buy some drugs. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/07/09/new-in-st-louis-people-getting-shot-for-not-buying-drugs/" target="_blank">In July we found out that you shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;No thanks.&#8221; because then you&#8217;ll get shot</a>, so we, being the kind, helpful, nice smelling, soul-meltingly beautiful site we are, we offered the following advice:

> If you live it St. Louis, it appears that when someone offers you drugs, it’s safter to just take some since the one thing you can’t go to rehab for a bullet in the chest. Please inform your kids about this change in standard parenting lesson protocol.

Turns out, we were wrong. It happens (rarely). Saying &#8220;Yes please, I&#8217;d love some drugs!&#8221; gets you just as shot as if you have said &#8220;No&#8221;. New rule: Don&#8217;t talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

> The shooting happened at the Mobil gas station on Grand and Natural Bridge around 5:30 a.m. Sunday.
> 
> The 27-year-old victim told police he was approached by a male suspect who asked to purchase drugs. The victim told police he agreed, but the suspect then pulled out a gun and shot the victim in the groin.

Oooooh! The groin?! That is not cool man. He said he wanted some drugs! You closed the sale dude, so that&#8217;s not the time to be shooting your customers. ABC is &#8220;Always Be Closing.&#8221; not &#8220;Always Blast Customers&#8221;. Your boss paid good money for those leads! You can&#8217;t close shit, you are shit! Hit the bricks pal and beat it because you are going out! Good luck winning this month&#8217;s Cadillac Eldorado now with that kind of sales technique. You wanna see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you&#8217;re fired&#8230;but we&#8217;re probably not going to do that seeing as you enjoy shooting people so much, so now third prize&#8230;is whatever change I have in my car&#8217;s cup holder. It&#8217;s mostly pennies, sorry. Please don&#8217;t shoot us in the groin.

The victim is listed as being in stable condition, but no mention on the condition of his junk. Silver lining: He did eventually some of those drugs he was looking for at the hospital!
