Gladys was a hoarder, which if you ask cable TV, is all the rage these days. Well if it&#8217;s chic to be a hoarder these days, then ole Gladys really should have been a celebrity, because as she quietly went about the final weeks of her life Gladys was hoarding on another level! When relatives were going through her &#8220;stuff&#8221; they found&#8230;her mother!

Yup, Gladys was hoarding the mummified body of her own mother&#8230;who, by the way, was also named Gladys&#8230;Gladys Stansbury.

> On Feb. 26, a relative helping clean out Bergmeier&#8217;s home came across the remains, wrapped in plastic and a multicolored curtain. The remains were partially dressed in a pajama top and camisole, and had a sock on the right foot. The remains had no broken bones or signs of trauma.

> &#8220;It appears (Bergmeier) couldn&#8217;t let go (of her mother),&#8221; Haugen said. &#8220;This woman always had excuses as to where (Stansbury) might be. As time went on, people just stopped asking.&#8221;

That&#8217;s old people for you. Keeping things that have long since died around their house for no reason other than they&#8217;re used to seeing them: green and yellow wallpaper&#8230;wide ties&#8230;every pair of over-sized, odd-framed eye glasses they&#8217;ve ever owned&#8230;their long dead mother wrapped in plastic&#8230;hard candy&#8230;

Frankly we&#8217;re wondering how the how didn&#8217;t collapse on itself after the batter royale that must have happened in there between the dead person and general old lady smells. No way Febreeze has a chance in that fight. Sure, you&#8217;d probably try the old &#8220;breathe with your mouth&#8221; technique, but we hate that&#8230;makes us feel like we&#8217;re eating the stink now and that&#8217;s much worse. Breathing through your mouth in there would be like eating moldy cheese out of Louie Anderson&#8217;s butt crack&#8230;after he had just done like 30 squat thrusts&#8230;in a sauna&#8230;after eating ten of those sick ass looking shrimp tacos from Taco Bell. Oh you get it? Ok, we&#8217;ll stop.
