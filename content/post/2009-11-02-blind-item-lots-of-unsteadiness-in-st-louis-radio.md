After the [abrupt cleaning job at K-Hits last week][1], it seems the St. Louis radio landscape.  Here&#8217;s a purposely vague  summary of what we are hearing:

1. It&#8217;s been about a year that this much talked about station has launched, what contracts will failed to be renewed?

2. Could there be a shake up in the mornings for a station down the hall from item #1?  We doubt it but contract negotiations aren&#8217;t starting off well.

Ratings are great, but if you aren&#8217;t making money your high-priced talent needs to be a little less high-priced.
