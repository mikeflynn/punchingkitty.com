> Radio trades and Secret Squirrel seem to agree: Bull mid-dayer **Jill Devine** is now officially on mornings permanently and PD Billy Greenwood is moving from PM Drive to Mid-days.

We don&#8217;t listen to country music, but we do love Jill Devine and hope she does well in her new time slot!

That being said, this was yet another truly bizarre move by Clearchannel.
