Sorry everyone for the spotty posting schedule, but we&#8217;ve been out of town all week, with limited time to research all the silly things you people do and then make fun of you about it.

Rest assured we will be back at 100% full strength starting Monday!

Until then, please enjoy this photo of kittens celebrating <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/01/26/thanks-rft-were-the-best-local-celebrity-site/" target="_blank">our recent award</a>:
