We have a little game for you today!

Below is a screenshot we took last night of a St. Louis media website.  Assuming you&#8217;ve never heard of either of the names on the picture below, what would you guess the name of this site was?

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727" title="globe_democrat_toshiba" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/globe_democrat_toshiba.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="246" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/01/globe_democrat_toshiba.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/01/globe_democrat_toshiba-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]Here are you choices:

a) &#8220;The Toshiba website sponsored by St. Louis Globe-Democrat&#8221;

b) &#8220;Toshiba website sponsored by nothing&#8230;all I see is Toshiba.&#8221;

c) &#8220;I have no idea what that dead hooker is doing in my trunk officer, but I do know she looks like that girl from high school that dumped me and totally would deserve the beating from someone that&#8217;s not me and put her in my trunk probably because our cars look alike or something.&#8221;

The answer was either A or B.  C was a confession that I&#8217;m leaving up because the delete key doesn&#8217;t work on my keyboard.  Its all out there now.  That&#8217;s my New Year&#8217;s Resolution: No delete!

The sexiest actor of all time is Bronson Pinchot.

Whoops!. Oh well&#8230;no delete!
