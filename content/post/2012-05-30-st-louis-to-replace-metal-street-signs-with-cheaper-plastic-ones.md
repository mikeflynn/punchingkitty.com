Apparently St. Louis has a major issue with people stealing street signs. One theory is people are stealing the metal signs to sell to scrap metal dealers, while our theory is that people are stealing them to put under their shirts for cheap bullet-proof vests. Either way it&#8217;s a problem.

> The city says signs are being stolen from all neighborhoods and cost anywhere from $90 to $150 to replace.

Well that is a waste. We, as a city, should figure out a solution to the greater crime problem. Maybe find a way to get _more_ police on the street and stop all crime, from sign stealing to back alley murders! Who&#8217;s with us?!

> The city hopes to put a stop to theft by using plastic signs.

Ah, ok, that&#8217;s another way to go. Let that be a lesson to the rest of you: If you want the criminals of St. Louis to stop stealing your stuff, just get crappier stuff! Why didn&#8217;t we think of this?! We&#8217;ve even done it before&#8230;remember way back in the day when people kept stealing our mayor? Well we don&#8217;t have that little problem any more!
