Brad Penny, he of <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/27/brad-pennys-girlfriend-is-straight-bangin-yo" target="_blank">his hot girlfriend</a>, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/04/27/brad-penny-has-a-perfectly-square-head" target="_blank">perfectly square head</a> and a handful of games as a Cardinal in 2010, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BradPenny/status/4267467232772096" target="_blank">took to Twitter yesterday</a> to say he&#8217;s sorry for not being around much this year. He&#8217;ll tell you what though! Next time, he&#8217;s going to pick us all up one weekend, take us for ice cream, go to a movie, and then the park! Anything you want Cardinal fans, it&#8217;ll be your day! No, this time he&#8217;s not lying&#8230;not like July, August, and September. He&#8217;ll be there. Promise!

> A ton of cards fans on here. Sorry about last season. Injuries are unfortunately part of the game but I enjoyed suiting up to play i&#8217;n [sic] front of some of the best baseball fans i&#8217;n [sic] America.

Penny even took the time to return fire on JoeSportsFan&#8217;s Matt Sebek&#8217;s equation of Penny to another dead-beat Cardinals pitcher:

Honestly though, if you have to blow out your shoulder, say you&#8217;ll be back in a few weeks and then get never seen from again, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Did-Brad-Penny-s-grand-slam-land-him-on-the-disa?urn=mlb-243029" target="_blank">going out with a grand slam</a> is way better than saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get some ice. Be right back.&#8221;
