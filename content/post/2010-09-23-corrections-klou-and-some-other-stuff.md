Every now and then, we&#8217;re wrong. True story. It can happen to the best of us, and that&#8217;s obviously true since it happened to us and we are clearly the best of us.

Here, in no particular order, are a some corrections that need to be said:

&#8211; Our source was wrong as, in turn, were we when naming Steph Duran the heir to the KLOU drive-time spot. That job went to someone else you&#8217;ve never heard of: Cindy Collins. We were right about every thing else, including the hotness of Carrie Underwood.

&#8211; In a few recent posts we cited news sources at &#8220;via KSDK&#8221; when we should have said &#8220;via KSDK, who totally sucks still.&#8221;

&#8211; Tyra Banks never came to St. Louis, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/17/some-hot-mess-robs-southern-commercial-bank/" target="_blank">as we recently claimed</a>. Our apologies to Oprah Winfrey.

&#8211; The picture included <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/peta-protests-childrens-hospital-over-kitty-poking/" target="_blank">at the end of this post</a> wasn&#8217;t factual. We don&#8217;t shave our chest as suggested by that portrait.

We&#8217;re sorry.
