Friend-of-the-site, former St. Louis Ram and current country music artist, **Kyle Turley** will be making a stop in St. Louis Sunday to play at the <a href="http://oldrockhouse.com/kyle-turley-band/" target="_blank">Old Rock House</a> after two of his former teams go at it in the Edward Jones Dome, which by the way is officially no longer the worst NFL dome, so big congrats there for the Rams!

Congrats are also in order for the Kyle Turley Band as rumor has it that our editor will be out at the show personally taking some photos and giving out stickers.

Doors open at 11:30a ($6 cover)Â with the show starting a half hour after the Rams finish beating the Chiefs.

First person to make a Mike Martz joke or references throwing a helment to Kyle wins the chance to be &#8220;obvious joke guy&#8221; the rest of the night.
