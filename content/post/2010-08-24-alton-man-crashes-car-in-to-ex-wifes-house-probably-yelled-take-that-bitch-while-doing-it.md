Also, if anyone has a comb&#8230;no? That&#8217;s alright. Thanks for looking.

> Authorities say Fry&#8217;s ex-wife reported to police that extensive damage was done to her home. She was away from her home when the damage was done.
> 
> Authorities said the damage appeared to have been done by a vehicle being driven into the home. Evidence from Fry&#8217;s vehicle gave police the probable cause to take him into custody.
> 
> The victim had an active order of protection against Fry at the time of this incident.

We don&#8217;t know how much over $300 dollars of damage ole Billy did with his clearly cherished car, but seeing as we&#8217;re talking about Illinois and these people are the kind of people that get married and then decide running your car into the other&#8217;s home is the move we&#8217;re guessing&#8230;trailer tipped over&#8230;at least 3 pink flamingos destroyed&#8230;and the George Forman Grill plugged in outside will probably not be able to correctly grill both sides of her Hot Pocket again. Gonna have to flip that \`Pocket over half way through.

That&#8217;s no way to live.
