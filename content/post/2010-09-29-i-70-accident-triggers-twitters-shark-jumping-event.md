Yesterday at the downtown lanes of I-70 a tractor-trailer, a flat bed truck carrying concrete sewer linings and three other cars came together is in the eastbound lanes. The cause was later found to be a driver that stopped in the road to pick up road dibris, causing a slowdown and then the pileup which <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/traffic/along-for-the-ride/article_c9eec19a-cb1b-11df-8a31-00127992bc8b.html" target="_blank">left the highway closed until about 2pm</a>.

Because of its downtown location, the accident could be seen from many office buildings including that of Jason Wagner, Twitter user <a title="Jason Wagner" href="http://twitter.com/threefourteen" target="_blank">@threefourteen</a>. An accident? To the Social Media Mobile!

This seem odd to anyone else? &#8230;Ok, I guess he couldn&#8217;t get word out any other way so&#8230;wait&#8230;

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mikeflynn_/status/25797573432" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7051" title="tweet_911_1" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/09/tweet_911_1.png" alt="" width="564" height="150" /></a>We had to ask! We get it, 2010, Twitter, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF6m1KQrGcE" target="_blank">ShaveMate</a>, we live in the future, but he probably tweeted this on his phone and isn&#8217;t 911 still the move here? Seriously, this isn&#8217;t weird to anyone else? &#8230;maybe it was on his computer and not a phone capable of dialing 911&#8230;

No it&#8217;s not _wrong_, but we are struggling with the desired response. Was someone to go &#8220;Oh no someone needs be at this tweet&#8217;s location! &#8230;better just reply back first.&#8221;?

Oh wait. Someone did:

Though she didn&#8217;t get to the scene in time, and in fact hasn&#8217;t made it yet, Dr. Quinn came up huge today when called upon by the &#8220;I do everything over Twitter even if it&#8217;s silly&#8221; crowd.

We feel safer knowing the world, and long cancelled tv doctors, are looking out for us. Now if you&#8217;ll excuse us, we need to go Facebook ourselves a dermatologist appointment. We were <a href="http://buzz.google.com" target="_blank">Google Buzz</a>ing over the weekend and <a href="http://Bebo.com" target="_blank">Bebo</a>&#8216;ed this chick with our <a href="http://Stickam.com" target="_blank">Stickam</a> in her <a href="http://DailyBooth.com" target="_blank">DailyBooth</a> while she <a href="yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a>&#8216;ed and <a href="http://Flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>&#8216;ed our <a href="http://Ning.com" target="_blank">Ning</a> and now we have this rash in <a href="http://MySpace.com" target="_blank">MySpace</a> that won&#8217;t go away.
