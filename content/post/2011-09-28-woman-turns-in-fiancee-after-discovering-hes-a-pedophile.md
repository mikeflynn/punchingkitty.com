&#8220;What? No! You&#8217;re crazy. He&#8217;s not like that at all!&#8221;

&#8220;We need a van because the extra cargo space is nice, ok?!&#8221;

&#8220;What do you mean we need more Butterfingers? Didn&#8217;t I just buy a bunch of them!?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh come on mom! How does someone look like a pedophile?&#8221;

&#8220;Hey honey? Can I borrow your phone for a second I gotta check the traffic for my dri&#8230;what the hell is this?!&#8221;

> A 34-year-old man from Wright City is jailed on child porn charges after his fiancee turned him in.
> 
> Authorities say that the woman found sexually explicit photos of an 11-year-old girl on Randall Abernathy’s cell phone.

We&#8217;re guessing the wedding is off, and that there&#8217;s one crazy big &#8220;I told you so!&#8221; waiting for the next time she visits her mom.

> Investigators determined that Abernathy had been taking photos of the girl for the last year, and also had “deviate sexual contact” with the victim.

We really don&#8217;t want to be the one to say &#8220;Geez, what did you think lady? This guy reeks of pedophilia!&#8221; &#8230;wait, that&#8217;s not exactly how I wanted that to sound. To be clear: We have no idea what &#8220;deviate sexual contact&#8221; with a minor smells like! However this guy does have that &#8220;I touch kids&#8221; vibe to him doesn&#8217;t he? The neck beard, the lazy eye, his iPhone&#8217;s wallpaper, the little kid on a leach he brought with him to the arraignment&#8230;

Note to all ladies: Guys like &#8220;School Girl&#8221; outfits, but when you put one on and he says, &#8220;Eh&#8230;I was hoping for footie pajamas and a pacifier.&#8221; it&#8217;s time to take another look at that phone because that might not be &#8220;his niece the gymnast&#8221; and it might not be true about how he said &#8220;Gymnasts never wear pants!&#8221;
