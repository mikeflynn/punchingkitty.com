I go to STLToday.com and I see this on the front page:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739" title="Screen shot 2009-09-18 at 12.09.56 AM" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-18-at-12.09.56-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-09-18 at 12.09.56 AM" width="484" height="445" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-18-at-12.09.56-AM.png 484w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-18-at-12.09.56-AM-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" />][1]This is it huh?  The day you just started running headshots on the front page.  None of us should be surprised, it was bound to happen.

Wait, maybe this head shot is of some news-worthy person that I&#8217;m not aware of, I&#8217;ll just check the caption.  &#8230; Nevermind.

I&#8217;ve just decided I&#8217;ll still keep coming here from time to time dispite the glamour shots home page&#8230;well unless I swing by and see that Dan Ceasar mug shot on the home page.  [That crap is scary.][2] I&#8217;ll be gone for good then.
