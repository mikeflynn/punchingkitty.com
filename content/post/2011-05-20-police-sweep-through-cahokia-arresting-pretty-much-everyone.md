In a shocking move the police finally got together to solve the problem and someone asked &#8220;Well, could just go get them at their house?&#8221;

That&#8217;s just crazy enough to work.

> Dozens of law enforcers swept every home, looking for wanted criminals.
> 
> “A lot of people scattered, retreated into their homes,” State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly said of the scene when officers rolled in.
> 
> Just an hour in, eight people had been arrested.

This new police strategy follows several previously less successful plans, such as &#8220;Wait to see if they turn themselves in&#8221;, &#8220;Dude, _Armageddon_ is on! We should order pizza and watch it at the station!&#8221; and &#8220;Eh, lets just see how it goes&#8221;
