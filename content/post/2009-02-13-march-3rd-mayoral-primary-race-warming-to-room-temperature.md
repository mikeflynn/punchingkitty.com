Driving around the other day I saw a &#8220;Reelect Slay&#8221; sign, which of course means its that time again!  The Demacratic Mayoral Primary is on March 3rd and Slay squares off against former Alderman and former second-fiddle to Slay in the last election, Irene J. Smith&#8230;.oh and some one else, but seriously&#8230;who cares?  The fact I even know Smith is running is because of [an article in the Post about how bad ass Mayor Slay is][1] with his campaign and because &#8220;she&#8221; started following my personal Twitter account!

Slay blogs (kinda) but Smith Twitters!  Are we looking at a Ron Paul situation with Smith?  Maybe!  Go iSmith!

Of course, it would really give her marks if she agreed to an interview of some kind for Punching Kitty&#8230;just saying&#8230;
