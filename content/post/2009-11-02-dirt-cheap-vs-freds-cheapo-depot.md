Fred has moved on, and if you want to know the details of his split from the Dirt Cheap conglomerate, check out the article that has so much detail you will forget why you cared about this and leave half way through on [STLToday][1].

What we at Punching Kitty want to know is:

Which commercial do you prefer?

The classic **Dirt Cheap**:



or the new **Fred&#8217;s Cheapo Depot**:



I know the Cheapo Depot is just starting out, but there&#8217;s something about the delivery that makes me think he is excited enough about the change to be able to really make some super horribly fantastic commercials in the near future.
