**Update #4:** Trade talk: [MLBTradeRumors.com][2] , [STLToday.com][3], [Boston Herald.com][4]

**Update #3:** Trade back on!  In a [tweet from Bernie Miklasz][5]: &#8220;Cardinals trade C. Duncan for J Lugo &#8230;. Cardinals won&#8217;t be responsible for Lugo&#8217;s big salary;&#8221;  [Viva El Birdos][6] was right all along!  Nice scoop guys!

**Update #2:** The optioning of Duncan has been further confirmed by [Joe Strauss over Twitter][7] and by  [insidestl.com][8]

**Update #1:** Bernie Miklasz said on 101 ESPN at 11:49pm that Chris Duncan will be optioned to Memphis, saying all player moves are &#8220;internal&#8221; meaning Julio Lugo is not involved.

**Original post follows:**

Thats what we are hearing, with the initial report from [Viva El Birdos][6], saying that Duncan was moved to the Red Sox for ousted shortstop Julio Lugo.

Lugo was set to be DFA&#8217;d (Designated for Assisgnment) which means they were just going to dump him, so they&#8217;ll take anything to make the deal somewhat more palatable like a bag of balls&#8230;or a hobbled DH that plays the outfield&#8230;

We are working to confirm.
