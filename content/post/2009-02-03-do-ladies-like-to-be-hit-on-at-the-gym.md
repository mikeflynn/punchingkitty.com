A fellow St. Louisian [asks on Craigslist][1]:

> Not really sure where this should be posted&#8230;but my question to you ladies&#8230; 
> 
> &#8230;while working out at the gym, do you/would you be open to a man approaching you? 
> 
> It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m afraid to, I just wonder bc I wouldn&#8217;t want to intrude on &#8220;your time&#8221;, as I&#8217;m there for the main reason of working out, but sometimes can&#8217;t help one of u catching my eye!

> Let&#8217;s hear what u have to say ladies!

He also included a photo of the Cardinals logo&#8230;you know, just to be super relevant.

So, well&#8230;would you?  While you&#8217;re working up a sweat, would you want the average St. Louis dude rolling up on you asking if you come here often?

Lets collect some answers here and then I&#8217;ll post them back on Craigslist for our friend.
