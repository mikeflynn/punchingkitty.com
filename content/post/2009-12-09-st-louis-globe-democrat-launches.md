Things looks good so far, and I really hope they do well since we need another strong news source in this town, but I do have a few questions:

**1.** They do know that their website doesn&#8217;t have to just look like a boring old newspaper right?  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the newspaper look can be awesome, <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/" target="_blank">but this isn&#8217;t it</a>.  If you want to do the newspaper thing look at this: <a href="http://www.instablog.org/" target="_blank">www.instablog.org</a> That&#8217;s how you do a newspaper website!

**2.** If <a href="http://www.globedemocrat.com/" target="_blank">GlobeDemocrat.com</a> is a blog about the old Globe-Democrat newspaper and then the Globe-Democrat relaunches itself as a website, couldn&#8217;t they get that domain instead of using <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/" target="_blank">globe-democrat.com</a>?  I mean, whats the point of the blog now anyway?

**3.** I&#8217;m sure their staff is pretty small, but I really hope they get more unique content than a few articles surrounded by news feed articles from STATS.  They will need some voices to make this thing go anywhere.

**4.** <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/weblogs/groups/" target="_blank">This page</a> could use some work.

**5.** Their privacy policy has a few holes in it&#8230;normally this isn&#8217;t something I would really feel the need to check in to but&#8230;well&#8230;<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/kurt-greenbaum/" target="_blank">you know</a>.

First we have this (emphasis mine):

> Personally Identifiable Information collected by Globe-Democrat.com may also be used for other purposes including but **not limited to site administration and troubleshooting**. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may access such information.

&#8230;and then this&#8230;

> As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. **We may also disclose your information** in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or **whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary** to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

I&#8217;m sure they mean well, and I&#8217;m not here to try and accuse them of things they haven&#8217;t yet done, but this thing is like swiss cheese.

**6.** <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/staff/howard-balzer/" target="_blank">Howard Balzer</a> on sports?!  Ugh!  Really?  There wasn&#8217;t anyone else?!  If you wanted a jersey chaser to write for you there are lots of girls out there that are way more attractive with only a slight loss in writing acumen. &#8230;nice work picking up <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/staff/bj-rains/" target="_blank">BJ Rains </a>though.
