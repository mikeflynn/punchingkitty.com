What better way to kick off your Friday?



You may think you know that Chuck Berry is old, and its true, but no many know how old he _really_ is.

One day I saw Blueberry Hill owner Joe Edwards in a barbershop and I went up to him and said, &#8220;Joe, between you and me&#8230;how old is Chuck Berry.&#8221;

Joe looks at me and says &#8220;Hey, Chuck Berry is 137 years old.&#8221; Â 137 years old!
