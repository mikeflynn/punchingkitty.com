Have you seen the All-Star game commercials running on Fox yet?  Here it is:
  


What did you think?  I thought it was a bit odd.  The Arch as a magnet?  What?!  I just don&#8217;t get it.  Can anyone explain why they went this way with a whole world of other, less odd, choices were in front of them?

The one part that was pretty awesome was when Derek Jeter got &#8220;yanked&#8221; [_Editor&#8217;s Note: Mental rimshot!_] off the field, but Robinson Cano was left standing there like a douche.  Way to be a good sport Cano!
