Arriving just in time to catch the parade allowed us the chance to snap possibly our favorite photo of all time (above).

  6 hours, 5 tacos, 1 margarita, and tons of photos later we realized we had spent the whole day down there and it was time to head back and put together the video below.

  People ask us all the time: &#8220;You take so many shots at St. Louis, why don&#8217;t you move?&#8221; Stuff like this is why.
