No, this isn&#8217;t <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/12/06/ksdk-sports-2012-looks-like-the-worst-game-ever/" target="_blank">another KSDK commercial</a>, this is the infamous Taiwanese news animation and they have turned their focus to our very own&#8230;er, Southern California&#8217;s Albert Pujols!

Check out the video above (with subtitles) to watch Pujols drop his bat during a Cardinal game to chase a bag of money then literally gun down Rangers pitching and follow all that up with a montage of him aging through his contract until he can barely hold his bat! Actually, that is as good of a description of the story as we&#8217;ve heard so far. Nicely done Taiwanese news for getting a better handle on the situation than the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/burwell-pujols-deal-belies-cardinals-actions/article_76a196f1-21c2-5e55-a8df-0d62ce716957.html" target="_blank">Post Dispatch&#8217;s Bryan Burwell</a> despite being 6,000 miles away!
