We&#8217;re all for fall to start, but what a turd of a Labor Day! It&#8217;s rainy, the Cardinals are old and broken, there aren&#8217;t any full posts on any of the good websites today (especially Punching Kitty), and this morning we woke up too late to enjoy some Save By the Bell on MTV2!

We&#8217;ll try to get some BBQing done anyway, and watch this crazy South Korean music video for an extra shot of happy:

See ya tomorrow!
