Kenny Gooch was sitting on his front porch in Maplewood one day and while he was watching a few high school girls walk by he decided to whip his junk out and smack it around a little. Who&#8217;s gonna know right? You way up on this porch and they&#8217;re way over there down two steps and over on the sidewalk 5 feet away. It&#8217;s the perfect crime!

So perfect he did it twice.

To the same girl.

Possibly using a different hand, but that really doesn&#8217;t seem like a pertinent detail.

> Police said Gooch was sitting on his front porch and committed the act while they were walking by, near Maplewood High School.
> 
> According to police, he did the same thing to one of the girls a week earlier. The girl told her parents about the first incident, but they did not call the police; however, they contacted police after the second incident and Gooch was taken into custody.

Good life lesson for your young daughter: Sure it&#8217;s gross, but lets not do anything until it happens _twice, _because that&#8217;s the magic number where horrible sexual acts directed at under-age kids becomes a problem. Only once? Walk it off. &#8220;What? You saw Mr. Gooch jerking it on his porch while you walked by?! Well! &#8230;if he does that again, we will certainly be forced  to call the police. The first time might have been a accident and the neighborly thing to do is not report it just yet.&#8221;

As for Gooch (this guy has the name of an extra from Porky&#8217;s, so there&#8217;s a part of us that wasn&#8217;t all that shocked by this story when we saw his name), he&#8217;s been charged with second-degree indecent exposure and three counts of sexual misconduct. However, as you can see above in his mugshot, he&#8217;s not sweating it. He&#8217;s got the look of a man saying to himself: &#8220;What should I have done here? _Not_ masturbate as the 16-year-olds walked by? Maybe. But I didn&#8217;t, so whatever. Just one of those things ya know?&#8221;
