Katz** for his F-ed up blog posts about defending homophobia and other fun stuff like **“Why Terrorism is Important”**.

We were still totally happy that a St. Louis mind got in the game!

&#8230;well move over Detroit. We&#8217;re gonna need a seat on the bench after all.

> Jonathan I. Katz, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis., said he was fired from the team of scientists chosen by U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu to help BP Plc control the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
> 
> “Some of Professor Katz’s controversial writings have become a distraction from the critical work of addressing the oil spill,” Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said in an e-mail today. “Professor Katz will no longer be involved in the department’s efforts.”

Geez you do one little post about how terrorism is important that the United States government gets all bent out of shape! I mean they are building a new building aren&#8217;t they? Man. Let it go already.

> “I don’t self-censor myself,” Katz, 59, said in a phone interview today. “There’s no doubt there are things on my webpage that’ve been there for many years that are fairly controversial.”
> 
> He was fired from the panel this morning, he said. He declined to specify which articles triggered the dismissal.

We&#8217;re guessing it was the &#8220;terrorism is kickass&#8221; one&#8230;or maybe it was _&#8220;I&#8217;m Scared of Gays&#8221;_. But after looking through a few more it could have been his article &#8220;Why I think Oil Spills are Awesome: Ducks Look Better All Black&#8221; or the secularly popular _&#8220;Shut up black guys&#8221;_. It probably was one of those. Here are a few others that we don&#8217;t think caused the issue themselves, but you never know:  _&#8220;Touching My Balls and Shaking Your Hand&#8221;_, _&#8220;Defending People Who Make That Smacking Sound When They Eat&#8221;_, _&#8220;Don&#8217;t Ya Sometimes Just Wanna Rape a Chick?&#8221;_ or _&#8220;I Just Got the Put on This Oil Spill Think Tank Put Together By Ugly People and Run By Dummies&#8221;_.
