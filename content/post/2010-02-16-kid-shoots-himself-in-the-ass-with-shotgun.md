On Saturday, a 11-year old boy was visiting someone when he wandered across a loaded shotgun.  You know how this goes&#8230;he started playing with it and some how managed to shoot himself in the butt.

He is in critical but stable condition.

From the <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/feb/14/child-critically-injured-after-accidentally-shooti/" target="_blank">Globe Democrat</a>:

> Authorities said the gun belonged to a 52-year old man who lives at the home on Dick Gregory Place. So far no charges have been filed against the owner of the gun.

Authorities plan to file those charges once they start giggling about the street name.

There are no details as to how the kid shot himself in the butt, which is too bad because I&#8217;m really not sure how that would go down.  Its pretty clear to us that there was a second shooter.  Here is our artist&#8217;s rendering:

&#8230;or he just turned it around or sat on it or something.  Who knows.
