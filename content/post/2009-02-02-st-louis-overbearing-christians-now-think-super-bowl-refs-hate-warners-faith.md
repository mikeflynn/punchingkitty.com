&#8230;I&#8217;m assuming.

I mean, its a safe bet right?  Look at the history:

1. Kurt does well but then after repeated beatings from a crappy offensive line, he play and health deteriorates to a point that St. Louis is forced to go with Marc Bulger.

2. St. Louis&#8217;s Overbearing Christians think the Rams and the people that support their decision hate Kurt not for this shoddy play, but because people hate his faith.

3. Years later: Kurt does well all year and then in the Super Bowl he lays an egg.  His throws were off all night, laying out his recievers all night with high passes.

4. Refs hate Christians.
