<a rel="attachment wp-att-5629" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/19/me-myself-some-guy-and-wang-exploring-chat-roulettes-missouri-section/chat_roulette_screenie/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5629" title="chat_roulette_screenie" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/chat_roulette_screenie.png" alt="" width="600" height="311" /></a>We&#8217;ve related Chat Roulette, the (in)famous site where you video chat with someone randomly, to our local area before when someone figured a way to grab screenshots of people and post them according to their geographic location. That was fun, but we wanted Chat Roulette to do the real thing: Make &#8220;local&#8221; channels to find random chat buddies.

Recently they did just that. (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/14/localroulette-channelroulette-chatroulette/" target="_blank">the TechCrunch article</a> about the new local channels)

&#8230;and we had to try it out. The video before is the screencast of our experience on the Missouri Chat Roulette channel. There weren&#8217;t many people in there, but even still I had no problem finding some oddballs. The video, embedded below, is slightly NSFW, but not really since we skillfully edited out anything that wouldn&#8217;t be good for your virgin little girl eyes.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/iDEkMJiTx3s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

In summary, its just like the regular Chat Roulette, but with less people. Same amount of dicks though.

You can make your own &#8220;adventure&#8221; on the new Missouri Chat Roulette channel (<a href="http://us-mo.chatroulette.com/" target="_blank">us-mo.chatroulette.com</a>).
