(We would have embedded it here, but CBS sucks and disabled embedding&#8230;and probably touches new born puppies in bad places.)

Interesting stuff about a case that so far, has netted very little int the way of details aside from a 911 tape that was as boring as they come despite <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_32feb11e-0ecc-5dec-a61f-bc8d2b045366.html" target="_blank">all the media outlets trying to make it interesting</a>. Oh god! The guy said &#8220;It&#8217;s dark in here!&#8221; No way! Someone must have been trying to hide the body by&#8230;turning out the lights?! If you have nothing interesting to report, just say &#8220;Nothing yet but we&#8217;re looking.&#8221; or just don&#8217;t say anything at all.

Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s out there just so we&#8217;re all clear:

&#8211; August Busch IV&#8217;s girlfriend was found dead in his house by a house staff member.

&#8211; Busch and &#8220;others&#8221; were home at the time.

&#8211; There were a reported 42 minutes between the body being found and the 911 call being placed.

&#8211; Cops aren&#8217;t publicly concerned with Busch IV or that any foul play was involved, suspecting an overdose but awaiting toxic screening results.

&#8211; The body was cremated.

&#8211; The family of the deceased has claimed that she wasn&#8217;t in to drugs, but she was a Hooters waitress and &#8220;aspiring model&#8221; dating a rich playboy beer baron, so&#8230;you know&#8230;we&#8217;ll see.

&#8211; We&#8217;ve also learned that pretty much any chick we a decent rack and photos online can be called an &#8220;aspiring model.&#8221;

Nothing more to report no matter how big the headlines are or how &#8220;shocking&#8221; one of the local stations anchors says their broadcast will be tonight (after sports and the weather).

Now if you&#8217;ll excuse us, we&#8217;re aspiring to go eat a sandwich.
