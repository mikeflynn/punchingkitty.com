> The mayor of Cottleville, a small Missouri town of about 3,000 people, is hoping the Missouri legislature passes a medical marijuana law, allowing those with prescriptions to buy the drug.
> 
> Yarber, 70, is promoting the concept among lawmakers, a big step for a small town mayor where many constituents are thought to be conservative. He said there may not be much support among lawmakers, but thinks there&#8217;s great support for medical marijuana among the public.
> 
> That&#8217;s why Yarber is suggesting lawmakers put the issue to a vote. He thinks by doing that, lawmakers won&#8217;t have to take heat, and the issue would pass with sympathetic voters.

Now, as long as we don&#8217;t have some douchey, stuffed suit guy ruin this for everyone&#8230;

> However, Yarber&#8217;s state senator, Scott Rupp, says it won&#8217;t happen.

Awwwwwww man!  Weak.  Narc!

In reply to Rupp&#8217;s comment&#8217;s Yarber replied &#8220;Dude.  You know?  Dude&#8230; Are you going to finish that?&#8221;
