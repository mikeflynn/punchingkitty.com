Three friends from the High Ridge, Missouri area got together to help one of the buddies move. As friend-based moving crews are tend to do, they moved beers to their face faster than anything else and soon the evening turned to less serious pursuits, namely watching he moving &#8220;Savages&#8221;. What was already a bad idea because of the fact that the one guy needed to get his stuff moved and &#8220;Savages&#8221; appears to be a pretty horrible flick (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/savages_2012/" target="_blank">51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes</a>), got worse when someone decided to act out a particular scene involving disarming someone in some badass way.

&#8220;Dude, I&#8217;ve got a gun! Lets try this for real!&#8221;

> Authorities said at one point the victim and one of his friends began to discuss disarming someone with a weapon, based on a scene from the movie. While they were re-enacting the scene, a 9MM handgun discharged, striking the victim in the torso.
> 
> Emergency crews responded and began treating the victim. He was taken to the parking lot of an area Walgreens store where he was airlifted to a hospital.

Guy #2 was taken in to custody at the Jefferson County Jail. The other guy is stuck with moving the rest of the stuff&#8230;No way is going to get that couch out of there on his own.
