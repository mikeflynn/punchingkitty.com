[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054" title="foursquare" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/foursquare.jpg" alt="foursquare" width="550" height="140" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/foursquare.jpg 550w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/foursquare-300x76.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />][1]There are 2 things that are up pretty high on the cool list these days: 1. Mobile apps (in particular the iPhone) and 2. location apps.  The problem?  Foursquare, the &#8220;cool kid&#8221; in the mobile location game space is still, at this time, not available for St. Louis!  Why Foursquare?!  Why!

What is Foursquare?  From [their site][2]:

> We&#8217;re all about helping you find new ways to explore the city.
> 
> We&#8217;ll help you meet up with your friends and let you earn points and unlock badges for discovering new places, doing new things and meeting new people.

That really doesn&#8217;t do it justice.  Foursquare is a location-based social network with game-like qualities.  Say you go out for the night and hit up Blueberry Hill, take out your phone and &#8220;check in&#8221; there.  Your friends will now know where you are, and if you check in there a lot, you can become the &#8220;mayor&#8221; of that location where you can dispense advice to future &#8220;check-ins&#8221;   You can also earn badges which are usually fun like the Bender Badge that you earn for going out to a bar several nights in a row.  (iJustine just put a post that goes in to greater depth on Foursquare today.  [Check that here][3].)

Awesome right?  So where _is_ it available?

> Amsterdam, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas / Fort Worth, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis / St. Paul, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC.

Damn, well all those cities are way better than&#8230;wait a minute!  Dallas / Fort Worth? Denver? Houston? Minneapolis / St. Paul?! Detroit!!!!!!!!!!  Dude.  Everyone is better than Detroit.

What does Foursquare have to say?

An email to Foursquare from a few weeks ago, asking when and if it will be arriving in St. Louis along with what we can do to help it along went unanswered.

We&#8217;d love it if we got an answer here though, so spread the word St. Louis!  Share this link!  We want foursquare!
