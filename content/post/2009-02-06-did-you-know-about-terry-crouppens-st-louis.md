Somehow I&#8217;ve managed to missed the insane bad TV brilliance of Great Day St. Louis until recently, and now I&#8217;ve been nothing but obsessed with watching clip after clip of a show that I keep waiting to end with &#8220;Gotcha!&#8221; or Will Ferrell announcing &#8220;the weather man is dead!  I killed the weather man!&#8221;

Take this little segment for example:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" title="picture-13" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-13.png" alt="picture-13" width="400" height="302" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/02/picture-13.png 400w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/02/picture-13-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />][1]

Apparently this segment, and I use that term loosely, is so that everyone&#8217;s favorite ambulance chaser tells us about some lawsuit and we are all supposed to pretend this isn&#8217;t an advertisement.  This time he told us the true story about that lady that spilled coffee on herself on and then sued and won.  Turns out, she&#8217;s a sad figure says Crouppen&#8230;oh and try to find out if Terry thinks the news people in the US are doing their jobs right or not.

_[Editor&#8217;s note: We wouldn&#8217;t make you watch the whole thing!  &#8230;plus they don&#8217;t have embed code [at their site][2], so we present the PunchingKitty Video Summary!]_

 

Third degree burns over 6% of her body?!  Well, 6% of an old lady&#8217;s body is more than I would want on me at one time, but really not all that much.  Could have been a thigh&#8217;s worth.  The third degree burns part is what&#8217;s a little hard to believe.  From [wikipedia][3]:

> **Third-degree burns** occur when the epidermis is lost with damage to the [subcutaneous tissue][4]. Burn victims will exhibit charring and extreme damage of the [epidermis][5], and sometimes hard [eschar][6] will be present. Third-degree burns result in scarring and victims will also exhibit the loss of hair shafts and keratin. These burns may require [grafting][7].

Coffee charred her skin?  Whatever.  The point is&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what the point is.  Really dumb intro to a commercial though&#8230;yeah!  Ok, that will be the point.
