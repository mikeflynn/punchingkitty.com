So nice in fact that the fact he said anything bad about the Cubs&#8217; stadium basically is the equivalent of us telling them that although old and quaint, their stadium is pretty overrated for a brick circle that makes me think more of a bull fighting right where the Cubs keep charging for that championship and whiffing each time than a baseball park. Then we&#8217;d like spit on the ground and do that thing to make them flinch and then call them a punk and walk away.

> The history and the field is all good. I always look forward to play (here) because it’s a great rivalry. (But) the playing field and all that, it’s not in the best condition you know. You’re glad you don’t have to play here for the whole year.

Oh snap.

Straight told you what&#8217;s up yo!

We like this move. Going forward any time we make someone our bitch like Pujols did the other day by dropping three home runs on the Cubs, I&#8217;m going to make fun of their house as a walk away. It will be easy for hookers since their houses always suck, with a bunch of bastard kid towns in the lawn. The challenge will be homeless people. &#8230;have to think on that one.
