> They were serving a warrant at the Mansion House Apartments on 4th Street in downtown St. Louis when they opened a container and were hit with a strong odor that caused headaches, breathing problems and profuse sweating.

What box horribleness be strong enough a stink to give three men headaches, breathing issues and sweating? Rosie O&#8217;Donnell probably has a box that horrible, but we can&#8217;t think of anything that bad in the bi-state area.

> There is no word on what caused the reaction, the investigation continues.  A test of the substance shows no hazardous material.  The officers are expected to be ok.

So it didn&#8217;t contain any hazardous material, but something must have made three grown men sick. What was in that damn box?! Yesterday morning&#8217;s slinger leftovers? A copy of &#8220;You Got Served&#8221; on DVD? Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s head? Damn, I guess we&#8217;ll never know what St. Louis cops hate so much just seeing it would make them fall ill&#8230;
