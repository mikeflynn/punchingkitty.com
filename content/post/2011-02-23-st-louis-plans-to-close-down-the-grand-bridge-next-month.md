Starting as soon as March 14th, the Grand Avenue bridge (from Chouteau to the highway 40 on ramp) will be closed for over a year as plans to replace the bridge and the Metrolink station below begin.

> Driving factors for replacement instead of repair are that the aging six-lane bridge was not built to withstand an earthquake, and meeting modern codes would cost too much. Plus, its sidewalks aren&#8217;t wide enough for the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Meanwhile, Metro buses often clog a lane of traffic while picking up passengers.

A year is an awfully long time to have a busy street like that out of commission, but the plans do make it seem worth it in the end:

> The new bridge will feature two lanes in each direction and a decorative planter in the middle of the street that will improve the look — and deter jaywalkers, Bradley said. It will have 13-foot-wide sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Equally important, it will have turnout lanes for buses on Metro&#8217;s busiest line.

Blow it up! We won&#8217;t miss having to slow down around morons crossing all 6 lanes at rush hour and getting stuck behind a bus after a miscalculated attempt to pass the moron going 13 mph in his blue and rust colored pickup truck.

Of course the one thing they really can&#8217;t fix is the fact that hey put a metrolink stop in the middle of a freaking bridge with nothing around it but dark streets. Any street that long, uninterrupted by cross streets, makes us feel like we are in a shooting range&#8230;a shooting range where the little metal ducks get raped afterwards. That won&#8217;t change, but they won&#8217;t let facts like that get in the way when they&#8217;re busy using up that big case of turd polish they just bought!

> Metro transit officials have timed their $7 million renovation of the Grand MetroLink station with the bridge replacement. The new station will feature an open plaza area on Scott Avenue that will be well-lit at night, said Chris Poehler, Metro&#8217;s senior vice president of engineering.

> &#8220;We always wanted to brighten it up,&#8221; he said of the Grand station, which sits in an industrial neighborhood. &#8220;Our goal is to take it from one of our least inviting stations to our most inviting station.&#8221;

Ok! &#8230;never gonna happen. First off, lets just get one thing straight: The &#8220;most inviting&#8221; Metrolink station translates to &#8220;the least stabby looking&#8221;, which is still a tall order for an ill-conceived Metrolink station that involves you walking a half mile from either direction away from anything of value other than a broke-ass Rally&#8217;s, and then down a thin stone staircase to wait on a little cement island surrounded by industrial buildings just vacant enough that no one can hear you scream. &#8230;oh and now it will have lights so you can just get a good enough look at your attacker&#8217;s face that now he&#8217;ll have to kill you.

Nah! We heard crime&#8217;s getting better in the city. Go Billikens!
