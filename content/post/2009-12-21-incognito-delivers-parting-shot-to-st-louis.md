> &#8220;With the fine of 50 grand, I would have gladly paid more to get out of that situation in St. Louis,&#8221; Incognito said Sunday after the New England Patriots beat the Bills 17-10 in Ralph Wilson Stadium. &#8220;So I chalk it up to that.&#8221;

Nice. Yeah, like everyone sucked but you huh?  New teammates love to see that kind of attitude.

> In case you were wondering, &#8220;Captain Dipshit&#8221; started Sunday for the Bills and promptly committed three more penalties.
  
> &#8220;The way I approach the game,&#8221; Incognito said, &#8220;my intensity level and the way I play on Sundays, not one thing&#8217;s going to change. The foolish penalties and the selfishness, that has changed and it&#8217;s going to continue to change. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been working on for a very long time.

Judging by your last comment, it seems you have a lot to work on.

At least everyone on the Bills <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/12/17/the-bills-are-really-happy-to-see-richie-incognito/" target="_blank">thinks your #1</a>!  Oh wait.  I think thats the wrong finger&#8230;
