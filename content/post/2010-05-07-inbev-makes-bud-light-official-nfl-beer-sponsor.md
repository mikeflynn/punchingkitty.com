Sick of those stupid Miller and Coors commericals that plays constantly during the NFL season, mercilessly beating the hell out of a once semi-humorus premise.

Well you have one more season to get through.

> Anheuser-Busch&#8217;s flagship brand Bud Light will be the official beer sponsor of the National Football League, edging out rival MillerCoors, which said Tuesday it wouldn&#8217;t renew its deal.
> 
> Anheuser-Busch&#8217;s six-year deal, which begins in the 2011 season, is worth more than $1 billion, a person close to the league said Tuesday.

So much for that whole &#8220;Inbev will cut the Bud Light marketing money&#8221; thing huh?  Also interesting is that with a six year deal starting in 2011, there&#8217;s a chance St. Louis might be the home of the NFL beer sponsor, but have no local NFL team to watch.

The good news though is those damn Coors Light commercials with the coach videos are gone after this year as I don&#8217;t think you would get access to those videos without being the official sponsor of the NFL. It&#8217;s exciting to look forward to&#8230;horsies playing football?  &#8230;dammit. Bud Light commercials suck now too.

All of this reminds me of a story&#8230;I&#8217;m an awesome chick magnet that beats up guys that pop their collar and still have their frat letters on their car more than 2 years after graduating from college.

I didn&#8217;t say it was a long story.
