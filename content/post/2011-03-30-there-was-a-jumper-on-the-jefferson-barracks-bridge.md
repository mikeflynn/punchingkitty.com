As of this writing, that&#8217;s all the details we&#8217;ve heard.

We&#8217;ll just assume it was Fox Sports Midwest sports writer B.J. Rains, sad because the only Cardinal that will do an interview with him was traded to Seattle, and you can&#8217;t just keep interviewing that guy anymore, because that would look really pathetic and sad&#8230;wait <a href="https://twitter.com/bjrains/status/52915779821252609" target="_blank">never mind</a>.

Ok, so we don&#8217;t know who it was then. He was probably sad though&#8230;maybe he couldn&#8217;t get that song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FXU3RuX8eo" target="_blank"><em>Jumper</em> by Third Eye Blind</a> out of his head and he thought this would be the most appropriate way to get rid of it. We didn&#8217;t say it was a good theory. This is where we would just rip our shirt and flex our muscles to make half of you forget that stupid thing we just said.
