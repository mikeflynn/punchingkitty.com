Everyone is pissed. Well not everyone&#8230;Jake Westbrook is stoked.

> &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to go to a club that&#8217;s contending for a playoff spot and pitch in some meaningful ballgames,&#8221; Westbrook said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why you play the game, to get a chance to play in the playoffs and I look forward to doing that.&#8221;

Well that&#8217;s nice. Good for him. Get really for a cold clammy welcome Jake!

Unfortunately it was Ryan. &#8230; I can only speak for myself and not for everybody else. It&#8217;s nice to acquire a guy like Westbrook, and it&#8217;s hard to lose a guy like Ludwick. There&#8217;s no question.&#8221;

Cold vibes coming from Carpenter, but the off-the-record Cardinal quotes Joe Strauss got are much better:

> &#8220;Please tell me there&#8217;s something else happening,&#8221; one player said.
> 
> Told nothing was imminent, the same player wondered aloud, &#8220;What the hell are we doing?&#8221;

The opinionated press were no more kind on the deal as the players were. Bernie Miklasz quickly blasted the deal:

> When you have a lethargic offense, you don&#8217;t give up an above-average run producer for an average starting pitcher. And that&#8217;s especially true in a summer 2010 trade market that&#8217;s seen a devaluation of starting pitching.
> 
> This was a three-way trade involving the Cardinals, Cleveland and San Diego, with Ludwick headed to SoCal.
> 
> It could have been a game of three-card Monte, with the Cardinals getting snookered.

Finally, how did Ludwick himself feel about the trade that sent him to Southern California?

> One eyewitness to Ludwick&#8217;s departure Saturday described him as &#8220;crushed&#8221; by the move when he left Busch Stadium around 1:30 p.m.

Dude. Cheer up. Avocados are cheaper out there&#8230;so you got that going for you.

Though we are all for the trade of Ludwick, we aren&#8217;t a fan of this particular deal. By all accounts Ryan Ludwick was well-like in both the clubhouse and the stands and managed to hold off the injury bug for a few years in St. Louis long enough to put up some numbers. We see the Cardinals side for sure: 2008, Ludwick&#8217;s best year, looks like an outlier and would be hard for him to repeat in both numbers and staying healthy, all while his price went up on a suddenly cost-concious club with Pujols&#8217; new contract looms. It&#8217;s clear that no matter when the traded Ludwick, people would have felt the same, but getting more than 2 months of Jake Westbrook&#8230;like maybe a shortstop that can hit&#8230;would have surely lessoned the blow.
