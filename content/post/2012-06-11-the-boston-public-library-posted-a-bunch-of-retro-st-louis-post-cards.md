The Boston Public Library has posted a whole set of retro Missouri post cards on their Flickr page (Kids, you know when you&#8217;re trying to text a pic to someone and your AT&T phone is crazy slow because you&#8217;re in one of those random parts of town with a max of one bar? The message eventually gets to the person, but then you&#8217;re like &#8220;Oh yeah, I forgot I sent that.&#8221;? That&#8217;s basically what a &#8220;post card&#8221; is.), and they&#8217;re pretty great. Not sure why the Boston Public Library is doing the stuff the St. Louis Public Library should be doing on it&#8217;s own, but whatever. We&#8217;ll deal with them later.

The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/sets/72157626153882445/with/5531564261/" target="_blank">whole list</a> is worth flipping through, but here are a couple that caught our eye:

Here&#8217;s the Forrest Park Jewel Box back when it looked like it might have actually been interesting, before it became a place you forget exists until you see it on a wedding invitation.

Here&#8217;s one of Busch Stadium&#8230;no, not the one with the giant Hardee&#8217;s sign, but the one before the one before that. We think that one might have had a Carl&#8217;s Jr. sign though.

Here&#8217;s the 7 Acres Motel in Wentzville, MO who was well equipped with air conditioning and &#8220;preview television&#8221;. WiFi was still $10 a night.
