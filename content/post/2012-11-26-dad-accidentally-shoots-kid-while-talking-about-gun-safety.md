A father shot his 11-year old kid in the face Friday night during a discussion on firearm safety in St. Joseph, Missouri. Seems like a tough lesson, we guess this is one of those &#8220;building character&#8221; kind of teaching moments and it probably worked. Junior&#8217;s not going to forget where the safety switch is now.

> The St. Joseph News-Press reports that the boy sustained serious injuries Friday night while cleaning guns and planning a hunting trip with his father.
> 
> Shelton says the projectile lodged below the boy&#8217;s jaw. The boy was able to walk to the ambulance. He was taken to a St. Joseph Hospital and then flown to Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.

How long do you think they all rode in the ambulance until the dad turned to his son, patted him on the back and said &#8220;Lets not tell mom about this, ok?&#8221;
