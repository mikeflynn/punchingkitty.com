As with the majority of the Cardinals&#8217; playoff games, our fearless editor took to Twitter to comment on the Cardinals World Series Champion parade and Busch Stadium event. If you already follow <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a> then you have no doubt already seen this, but others that missed it because they are too &#8220;emo&#8221; for Twitter have asked for a way to check it out so here, for posterity sake, is the annotated timeline with a few retweets mixed in from others.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **I guess I won&#8217;t be at Busch for the celebration. Couldn&#8217;t find a parking spot closer than my house and Robin doesn&#8217;t feel well anyway. #lame

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Parades don&#8217;t need commentators.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:**&#8220;88 years young…&#8221; Get it?! Because people usually say &#8220;old&#8221;. Fox2 sucks at this so hard.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:**Jon Jay&#8217;s index finger is wilting.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Maybe me watching the parade at home commenting via Twitter is poetic as I didn&#8217;t get to go to a game all year, live tweeting instead.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Fox2&#8217;s anchoring trying to talk about sports is so freaking horrible the entertainment value is growing on me. &#8220;There&#8217;s Yadi…the catcher.&#8221;

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Oh look there&#8217;s Theriot. …everyone wait for him to fall off the truck. Don&#8217;t worry Frucal will come by and help him out later.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** McGwire is taking photos with his iPad…why not? [Reference Pic via **<a href="http://twitter.com/athooks" target="_blank">@athooks</a>**: <a href="http://twitpic.com/78jrma" target="_blank">twitpic.com/78jrma</a>]

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Chris Carpenter is really excited as his arm hasn&#8217;t fallen off yet. Saving that for Spring Training I would assume.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Lance Lynn is out now…Motte was scheduled to be in that truck originally, but well…you know.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Fox2 is really obsessed with the &#8220;team effort&#8221; idea, which is special because one really good player is usually all teams need. Right A-Rod?

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Ok, so which player will drop an F-Bomb over the stadium mic? Jay&#8217;s got a shot, but my money&#8217;s on Motte.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Parade security should be on the lookout for Rams players trying to sneak in and pretend people like them (yes I know they won today)

**<a href="http://twitter.com/ericasmith" target="_blank">@ericasmith:</a> **&#8220;This is a happy parade.&#8221; #sigh

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Tom O&#8217;Neal is really missing the teleprompter right now. He&#8217;s dropped about 100 &#8220;ugh&#8221;s so far. #fox2

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mattsebek" target="_blank">@mattsebek:</a>** Cardinals broadcasting car just went by.  Dan McLaughlin was not driving.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Fox2 parade insight: &#8220;The fans and players are smiling.&#8221;

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Totally weird how everyone&#8217;s destiny is to win stuff.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/boxcar_fritz" target="_blank">@boxcar_fritz:</a> **Please tell me there is a Corey Patterson truck contributing to the parade. #stlcards

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Parents! Make sure you take the kids to the Yadi Molina Neck Tattoo painting booth.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/jbacott" target="_blank">@jbacott:</a>** Suggestion to Fox2, just loop &#8220;Celebration&#8221; and &#8220;The Heat is On&#8221; over and over again in place of the commentary and interviews.  Trust me

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Tony rocking the &#8220;Happy Flight&#8221; sweatshirt. Much better than <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/10/2006_tlr_shirt.jpeg" target="_blank">[the 2006] attire</a>.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Don&#8217;t you just want to set that World Series trophy on the other side of the room and see how many bean bags you can throw in to it?

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Dan McLaughlin sighting! Remember Dan, they&#8217;re just brownies, not love.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Um…yeah. You could say the same during the whole World Series. “@KSDK_Sports: only one teams baseball stadium is sold out today&#8230;”

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Arthur Rhodes has nothing to say.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Good, I was really hoping we&#8217;d get to hear Charles Dooley babble on like a Tracy Morgan character.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/jbacott" target="_blank">@jbacott:</a>**  David Freese gets a key to St. Louis City and St. Louis County. Way to summarize the bizarre layout of our city in two awkward presentations

**<a href="http://twitter.com/gabehartwig" target="_blank">@gabehartwig:</a>** Here&#8217;s a key to the city. Can you watch our cats?

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **@gabehartwig No, but a key to the city explains all the home invasions.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Nothing like having everyone say how important trading you away was to the season huh Colby Rasmus?

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **&#8220;Drunk Carp&#8221; is the second best kind of Carp, after only &#8220;Yelling at Brendan Ryan Carp&#8221;

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **That was embarrassing Horton. Stop making people chant marketing gimmicks.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/boxcar_fritz" target="_blank">@boxcar_fritz:</a> **Wait&#8230; Mike Claiborne is black?

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Thanks Tony for walking us through that joke.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Check out Tony with the prepared schtick!

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **Carpenter can&#8217;t shut up and I love his drunken inside jokes.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/boxcar_fritz" target="_blank">@boxcar_fritz:</a> ** La Russa was two minutes away from talking about how he used to tie an onion to his belt, as was the style of the time. #stlcards

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** Nice of Tony to throw a nod to the other town&#8217;s sports teams that everyone forgot we had.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>: **That last spe[e]ch was like the principal&#8217;s awkward buzzkill at the end of the high school prom. &#8220;Stay safe and see you Monday morning!&#8221;

**<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_" target="_blank">@mikeflynn_</a>:** The MLB Playoffs are now over. We will now return you to the regularly scheduled NFL season, already in progress.
