[<img class="size-full wp-image-7922 alignright" title="teenage-ninja-turtle-pizza-party-830-pm-i-like-turtles" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/11/teenage-ninja-turtle-pizza-party-830-pm-i-like-turtles.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" width="250" height="187" />][1]You know how when you walk over one of those big sewer grates you always grip your keys a little harder, because that would suck donkey balls to drop your keys down a sewer. Then what? No way would a stick work to fish them out. No one&#8217;s going to help you, so you&#8217;d be totally screwed. At least you have your cellphone&#8230;which is in your car! Shit! Oh man, oh man, oh man.

Ok, now replace &#8220;keys&#8221; with &#8220;your child&#8221;.

A 19-month-old child was walking with his dad when he slipped and fell seven feet down an open sewer grate.

> &#8220;Soon as I got down there he was crying,&#8221; says Dennis Tabb with the St. Louis Fire Departmetn [sic]. &#8220;I said his name, got down there, called him. As soon as I got him, he grabbed right on, passed him right up.&#8221;

The 19-month-old is fine after a bath and he was only down in the sewer aka the &#8220;North St. Louis Simulation Tank&#8221; for about 10 minutes. Too bad, that&#8217;s totally not enough time to get any mutant powers or befriend a ninja-trained rat.
