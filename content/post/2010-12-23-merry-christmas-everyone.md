We&#8217;ll be back next week after taking a couple of days off for Christmas.

It&#8217;s a long time until Monday, and since you&#8217;re probably going to be lost without our guidance, here&#8217;s a few little tips to get you through the holiday:

**5**. _Die Hard_ is the best Christmas movie of all time. Shut up about _It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life_ or _Elf_.

**4**. It&#8217;s on the record now, even the Mayor&#8217;s office isn&#8217;t safe:

**3**. Remember ladies, the Sexy Mrs. Claus outfit is always a great move this weekend, unless, of course you&#8217;re a large lady, in which case the Mrs. Claus outfit makes you look like a North Pole tranny. If you&#8217;re big just forget we said anything&#8230;oh look over there! Cookies!

**2**. Reminder: Even a candy cane can be licked down to a point and shoved in to your chest while they take your car. We would recommend just staying away from the Galleria completely to be on the safe side.

**1**. For us, don&#8217;t make your cat wear stupid stuff.
