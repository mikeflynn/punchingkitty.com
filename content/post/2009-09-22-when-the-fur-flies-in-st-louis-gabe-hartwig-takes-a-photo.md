The idea here is brilliant.  If you&#8217;ve lived or visited St. Louis, I know you&#8217;ve seen some spare hair lying on the ground and if you didn&#8217;t, look closer.  Its gross and its everywhere.  &#8230;so Hartwig decided to photograph it.

We caught up with Hartwig about what made him start to blog about weaves:

> Girl, You Lost Your Weave was born out of necessity. For a while now, I&#8217;ve been taking pictures of random chunks of weaves because it seems like they&#8217;re everywhere in this city. I&#8217;d put &#8217;em on Facebook, and my friends would tell me how hilarious they were and that I needed a Web site to showcase them.
> 
> So I started a Blogger site about a week ago, and my friends have been great about sending me their own weave sightings.
> 
> I love sites dedicated to unintentionally funny found things, and weaves seem to be what St. Louisans have a hard time holding onto the most.

Frankly, the world needs more blogs like this.  This is exactly why the internet is awesome.  I don&#8217;t think here is any higher praise than by being placed next to [Sneezing Panda][3], [Party Kid][4], and [Look at this Fu*king Hipster][5].

For that matter that fact that this hasn&#8217;t landed on the front page of BoingBoing yet is beyond me.  &#8230;so we submitted it.  Here&#8217;s hoping it make it and you get crushed with traffic Gabe!
