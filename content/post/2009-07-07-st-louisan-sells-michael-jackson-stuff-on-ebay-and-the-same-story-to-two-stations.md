A St. Louis couple decided to sell off their Jacko memorabilia on EBay, and actually netted some pretty good dough for the stuff.  Not only that, but they got on TV!  Thats right, they made the local news and took the time to record the news broadcasts with their camera and upload it to YouTube.

&#8230;they also, inadvertently, managed to illustrate how lame and formulaic local TV news has gotten.



Notes:

&#8211; In the Fox 2 segment, does John Auble sound even more drunk than normal?

&#8211; The &#8220;family friend&#8221; that modeled the jacket, seems to be pretty attractive.

&#8211; How the hell is something &#8220;almost leather?!&#8221;

Discuss amongst yourselves.
