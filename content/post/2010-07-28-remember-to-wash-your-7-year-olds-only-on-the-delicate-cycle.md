> Authorities said Chloe CrowÂ and her sister tried to use a washing machine at a laundromat, but after putting their money in, the machine didn&#8217;t work. Chloe climbed inside the machine, thinking it was broken.

&#8230;yup, that&#8217;s the move. Please remember to tell this girl that this is an appropriate way to check if things are working. If the oven isn&#8217;t getting warm, climbing in isn&#8217;t your best option. Also sometimes crocodiles will sit still with their mouth open, don&#8217;t climb in there because they look like they aren&#8217;t working.

The girl is fine though after 155 staples and a few more stitches later, assuming you call looking like frankenstein fine. Her mother however is now out to find someone else to blame!

> Her mother said the machines should have an emergency shut down button.

Yeah, but why stop there?! Lets add a &#8220;whoops I wasn&#8217;t watching button&#8221;&#8230;it might be easier to just add a &#8220;do your damn job and watch your kids&#8221; button to her ass though.
