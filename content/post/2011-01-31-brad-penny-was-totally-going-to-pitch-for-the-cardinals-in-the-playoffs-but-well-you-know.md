Former Cardinal and perma-injured starting pitcher Brad Penny has been 20 times more interesting this off-season that he was in his official time as a Cardinal. To review, Penny signed with the Cardinals and pitched nine games all season. He hit a grad slam in that ninth game and never came back. Brillant! It&#8217;s a theatre technique called a &#8220;black out&#8221;. Look it up.  Since the season&#8217;s conclusion, Penny has filled his time by <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/11/16/brad-penny-is-sorry-for-being-a-dead-beat-pitcher/" target="_blank">whining on Twitter</a> and getting <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/01/10/nobody-likes-ex-cardinal-pitcher-brad-penny/" target="_blank">dumped on by everyone</a>.

Last week, Penny signed with Detroit Tigers, apparently they had a spot open on the trainer&#8217;s table, and in his press conference had this to say about his health while with the Cardinals:

> Penny made only nine starts with St. Louis a season ago before being sidelined with a back injury, but the right-hander says he was preparing to return before the Cardinals fell short of the postseason.
> 
> &#8220;I was throwing at the end of the year in case we made the playoffs,&#8221; he said on a conference call with reporters recently.

Sure you were buddy. Totally believe that.

&#8220;Dudes I&#8217;m back! I can totally pitch again! Arm feels great! Oh man I can&#8217;t wait to get out there and&#8230;what&#8217;s going on guys? Oh. The season&#8217;s over. Darn I was so ready to get out there and help the team too! Oh well. &#8230;Guess I&#8217;ll just grab these sacks here with the green dollar signs on them and be hitting that ole dusty trail&#8230;Really great meeting you guys! Byyyee!&#8221;

&#8230;and now, like the Cardinals of 2010, the Detroit Tigers have signed Penny to one year deal, as if Detroit needed more things to talk a big game about how everything is great and then crap the bed and whine how it&#8217;s not their fault. We aren&#8217;t sure how one could spin the economy in to being the reason why Penny&#8217;s arm will fall off in mid-June, but we can&#8217;t wait to hear the explanation.
