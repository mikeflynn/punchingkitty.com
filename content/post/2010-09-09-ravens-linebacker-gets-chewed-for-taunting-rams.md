&#8220;Hey you don&#8217;t make fun of and taunt the weaker kid! They suck, but they&#8217;re trying their best&#8230;sure none of it will matter and in the end, after a rough season of getting their brains bashed in they&#8217;ll somehow end up more &#8220;special&#8221; requiring them to wear helmets in normal non-helmet requiring activities and will join a Christian rock band that only gets gigs so that people can show up and say things like &#8216;Oh my. They really are giving it their all.&#8217; and &#8216;What little troopers! When they set their minds to something&#8230;&#8217; trailing off so they don&#8217;t have to actually say how bad it is. We all know where this is going, so there is no need to make fun of them! Now go sit down so they can stare at you with that creepy unblinking gaze retarded guys have.&#8221;
