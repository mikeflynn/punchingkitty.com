A house blew up in Florissant but it look like the blast might have been part of a suicide attempt rather that the usual St. Louis area meth-house explosion.

> “It blew it off the foundation,” said Deputy Fire Chief Scott Seppelt of the Florissant Valley Fire Protection District.
> 
> It appeared that the blast knocked out a window on a silver Kia Soul that was parked on the street near the house. [A neighbor] said that’s where authorities found a suicide note addressed to the dead man’s brother.

Nothing&#8217;s more depressing than finishing up your suicide note and then thinking to yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it on the counter&#8230;no wait, I&#8217;m going to blow up the house! I guess I&#8217;ll just leave it in my Kia Soul.&#8221; You&#8217;ve got it backwards bro. If you&#8217;re going to blow something up, let it be the Kia Soul. Since you&#8217;re on your way out anyway, do us all a favor and get those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zJWA3Vo6TU" target="_blank">stupid gerbils, or whatever they are, from the commercial</a> in the car before you light the fuse. Seriously, what the hell is with that commercial? As if poser gerbils driving a car wasn&#8217;t enough, now they have to dance in the middle of a futuristic intergalactic war? WTF is the point of all of this?! If you like those commercials, we can&#8217;t be friends. It&#8217;s as simple as that.

Doesn&#8217;t matter though, he already chose to take out the house instead of the car. If this is in fact a suicide, we&#8217;re torn on the approach. At first you think blowing yourself up is an interesting way to go out, but how did he know a neighbor kid wouldn&#8217;t be fetching a Frisbee next to his house? He didn&#8217;t, and it makes this a pretty dickheaded way to kill yourself and there are lots of better alternatives if that&#8217;s the way you want to go out. Don&#8217;t they have rat poison, guns or Taco Bells in Florissant?!
