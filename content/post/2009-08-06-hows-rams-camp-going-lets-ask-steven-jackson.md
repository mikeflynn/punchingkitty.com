Like most new coaches implement, the new Rams coach promised a tough training camp, and although we have just barely scratched the surface, we were wondering how it was going, so we turned to Steven Jackson, Rams running back&#8217;s Twitter account:

> I&#8217;m a beast with the shake. It must be camp time, LOL&#8230; [#][2]

> What&#8217;s up tweet family! Sorry I&#8217;ve been M.I.A but I go underground during camp. Get n my warrior spirit [#][3]

> Coach Spags, bought everyone Tony Dungy&#8217;s new book &#8220;Uncommon.&#8221; good choice [#][4]

> Smile even if ur hurting! [#][5]

> Just finished a pool workout. Hopefully the legs will continue to stay fresh. [#][6]

Oh and if you were wondering if Jackson keeps up with current events while at camp, wonder no more:

> Good look by US Gov. & Bill Clinton. Who cares if N. Korea trying to have propaganda. If it was me.. please come get me! [#][7]

Hang in there SJ&#8230;and don&#8217;t worry if you get tired, I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll get a 2-4 week break about a month in to the season like usual.
