Cats and 90&#8217;s alternative rock music have finally converged. Nothing else will ever be better than this&#8230;unless you&#8217;re **Collective Soul** who is now no doubt going through their back catalog and realizing that many of their songs could easily include a meow to make them substantially more interesting. Off the top of our heads, in addition to the below Shine: _Gel_, _December_, _Heavy_, _Breathe_, and _Goodnight, Good Guy_ could all easily incorporate this cat.

We as an internet have peaked with cat rock. Enjoy your remaining, what now must seem wholly insignificant, Friday.
