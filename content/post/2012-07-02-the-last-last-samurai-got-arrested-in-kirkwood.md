The movies taught us that &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221; was an Tom Cruise-looking American general with long hair, but as usual the real &#8220;Last Samurai&#8221; is some old skranky-looking guy from Kirkwood.

Here&#8217;s how it went down: Two guys start arguing in a Kirkwood home late last week and soon they were told to take it outside, which 46 year old William Earnhart did&#8230;right after he grabbed a samurai sword real quick, because fair shmair, you should have found a sword too if you didn&#8217;t want your arm cut off.

> Police said in court documents Earnhart and the victim were told to go outside to fight. As they left, Earnhart grabbed a 30-inch sword from the dining room and slashed the victim&#8217;s right arm to the bone, cutting a five-inch gash above the elbow, according to court documents.

Earnhart was later arrested at his house and admitted to being the crazy asshole that brought a sword to a fist fight. You gotta wonder about the other guy though who thought he could still hang in there when the other dude produced a freaking sharpened sword. Unless you&#8217;ve got some ninja stars in your pocket, you just bail at that point right? Maybe you hang in with a bow staff, but we&#8217;re thinking even nunchucksÂ aren&#8217;t enough to go with because unless you know how do something with them other than flourishes around your neck and shoulders and instead can do whatever it is you&#8217;re supposed to do with those that can actually hurt someone. Don&#8217;t get us wrong, the usual nunchuck tricks look really cool, but not totally effective when some dude&#8217;s whittling your arm down to a nub.

Wait, do nunchucks also shoot lasers? If they do then never mind.
