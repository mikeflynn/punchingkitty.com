It has come to our attention that the &#8220;featured&#8221; images above each story on the site, haven&#8217;t been making it in to the RSS feed. That sucks because 1. We love our RSS readers and that&#8217;s a bad experience, and 2. lots of jokes are based on those images.

We think we fixed it . Let us know if that&#8217;s not the case for you, or if you have a suggestion on how we can do it better.
