**Top 1st:** Oh yeah, this game started at 3pm. Thought it was at 4pm.

**3:09pm:** Shadows!!! Shadows!!!!!!!!!!

**Mid 1st:** We got a run! &#8230;that should be all you need, right Jamie Garcia? Carpenter said that one should be enough.

**3:23pm:** Braun home run, and then Fielder is plunked? Great start Garcia.

**3:26pm:** Garcia is coming loose. Not. Good.

**3:33pm:** &#8230;so the bottom of the 1st inning is still going on. That&#8217;s fun.

**Top 2nd:** Jamie is up now. Looking for that elusive bases empty two-run home run.

**Top 3rd:** Not sure if it&#8217;s TBS or UVerse, but we can&#8217;t see the game right now.

**3:57pm:** Ok, it&#8217;s back, but everyone is stuttering really badly and the broadcast is pretty bad in general. That&#8217;s probably just the way TBS is normally though.

**4:00pm:** Gone completely again&#8230;wait&#8230;I can see a Tommy Lee Jones commercial.

**Bottom 3rd:** Turns out it was TBS&#8217; HD feed that went down and the Standard Def is fine. This is troubling as we are only HD Cardinal fans. You can&#8217;t even read any of Yadi&#8217;s neck tattoos.

**4:07pm:** We just forgot who was batting and accidentally cheered. We apologize for that oversite.

**Top 4th:** David Freese, we love you. Expect a locket of our hair in your mail box.

**Top 5th:** Great play by big ass Prince Fielder! We felt the ground shake here in St. Louis when he dove for that ball.

**Bottom 5th:** Now we just need to hold on&#8230;hold on&#8230;.crap. Base hit Corey Hart.

**4:49pm:** Ok, so lets get a new pitcher shall we? No outs, Brewers on first and second with Braun up.

**4:51pm:** After a double and a home run, this will be the moment that everyone in St. Louis hates Tony LaRussa until the next game for not doing the obvious and pulling Garcia.

**4:55pm:** Good throw Dotel. Guess you weren&#8217;t that warm.

**4:57pm:** From @dgoold: &#8220;Again: Braun is 2-for-8 in his career vs. Dotel with a double and six strikeouts. SIX! If he wasn&#8217;t warming up for him, then who? #stlcards&#8221;

**5:01pm:** Home run. Cardinals down by 3. We wish there was a Rams game on suddenly.

**Top 6th:** From @mikeflynn_: &#8220;Nice of the Cardinals to fill the St. Louis sucking quotient while the Rams were off today.&#8221;

**Bottom 6th:** Lance Lynn is in the game as the new Cardinals pitcher. Dotel back to the clubhouse to finish that 3 lbs chili dog with a side of retirement he was working on before TLR interrupted him to go pitch.

**Top 7th:** Blah blah blah&#8230;stuff happened&#8230;still down by three.

**5:40pm:** Pujols doubles in a run! &#8230;double play that is.

**Bottom 7th:** Ugh.

**6:08pm:** From @mattsebek: &#8220;Nyjer Morgan with another tobacco toss after a strikeout.  Classy.  At least it wasn&#8217;t at the opposing pitcher this time.&#8221;

**Mid 8th:** Ugh.

**Top 9th:** \*fart sound\*

**The End:** Cardinals lose Game 1, 6 &#8211; 9.
