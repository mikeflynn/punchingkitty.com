You know that park you drive by all the time but never know stop at and always wonder what that big thing is? Well that&#8217;s Reservoir Park (at 44 and Grand) and 50 years from now it will be remembered like a hipster Gettysburg as a battle site of the 2012 &#8220;Class War&#8221;.

> The graffiti, which includes phrases like &#8220;CLASS WAR,&#8221;  and &#8220;COPS, PIGS, MURDERERS,&#8221; was sprayed on buildings, walls and statues at the park on Grand Boulevard just south of Interstate 44.
> 
> Paint on a door labeled &#8220;park police&#8221; reads &#8220;ONLY THE BLOOD OF THE RICH WILL STOP OCCUPY.&#8221;
> 
> The park was the site of a confrontation Thursday night between Occupy Midwest protesters in town for a regional conference and police trying to enforce a park curfew. More than a dozen protesters were arrested. Two of them were injured.

The Occupy St. Louis leaders have denounced the graffiti and apologized, which is nice of them since if you didn&#8217;t do it you don&#8217;t need to apologize even if they used your name. Just ask <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0937930/" target="_blank">TV&#8217;s Scott Wolf</a>. We splash lime Kool Aid on old people if they don&#8217;t remember the show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108894/" target="_blank">Party of Five</a> and Scott Wolf hasn&#8217;t called a single one of them to our knowledge.

The most destructive part of the graffiti was the spraying &#8220;CLASS WAR&#8221; on the &#8220;Naked Truth&#8221; statue.

> The painted words &#8220;CLASS WAR&#8221; on the brass [Naked Truth statue][1] will have to be removed carefully so as not to damage the patina, or protective coating, [John Maxwell, president of Compton Hill&#8217;s [Water Tower and Park Preservation Society][2]] said.
> 
> The statue was undergoing restoration and that will continue once the paint is removed, Maxwell said.

It was stupid to deface any public property, and <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2012/03/occupy_st_louis_graffiti_ignorance_unproductive.php" target="_blank">as the Riverfront Times pointed out</a>, it&#8217;s even more stupid based on the statue&#8217;s history, but it does kinda look cool. We&#8217;re not saying they should keep CLASS WAR on there, but that shade of blue with the statue&#8217;s old brass is kinda bad ass. Definitely clean this stuff off, since CLASS WAR is dump and sounds like a crappy punk pop band, but think about re-doing it with a light neon purple and the phrase &#8220;HAVE MERCY!&#8221; It&#8217;s a great message for the kids and Uncle Jesse should always be remembered for saying it when he saw a hot girl and occasionally for other non-sexy things at his own discretion.
