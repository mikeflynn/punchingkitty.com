There has always been a contingent that wasn&#8217;t a fan of her updating skills and still others believe that she was hired based on her looks rather than other, more radio-appropriate. skills.  From what we are hearing those whispers may have finally found the ear of those in charge at 101.  In fact, 101 ESPN has, within the last few days, posted a career opportunity for a &#8220;[Sports Update Anchor][2]&#8220;

Dayley has previously worked at 101 ESPN competitor, 590 &#8220;The Fan&#8221;.
