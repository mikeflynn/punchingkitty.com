Loesch continues her schtick, patented by [others before her][2], of smiling and not looking like a old bald rich white guy and then firing back with &#8220;well maybe they had a conceal and carry license?  &#8230;at least he didn&#8217;t shoot anyone with it!&#8221;   Although Loesch claims that there were scary guys looking to kick her ass, and frankly we don&#8217;t doubt that.  If we had to bet though, we&#8217;d put money on people _not_ wanting to kick her ass over her health care views, but rather because they had to work with her in planning last year&#8217;s Interactive Festival in the Loop.

One last thing Dana?  We think oh, a room full of black guys that don&#8217;t have mandated jobs these days, would disagree that the health care stuff is one of the &#8220;most important pieces of legislation in American history.&#8221;

Our favorite part is when the host politely told Dana to shut up.  I guess _that_ guy doesn&#8217;t want to get a guided tour of Shock City Studios!
