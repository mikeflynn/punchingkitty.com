> &#8220;Steven became enraged and pushed me to the ground, repeatedly.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;forcibly grabbed my arm and flung me against the door. I was crying and trying to protect my stomach from the blows, as I was 9 mos pregnant.&#8221;
> 
> and &#8220;continued to shove me against the door until his nephew &#8230; interceded and yelled, &#8216;uncle, she has a baby, stop.'&#8221;

A mere 10 days after the alleged beating, Jackon&#8217;s then girlfriend (she left him 4 months ago) gave birth to their son.

The two have more legal history as she is filing to get him to pay child support.

We have nothing but love for SJ39 recently, but this is even a little true, this is about as messed up as you can get.

TMZ is investigating and we will see what we can dig up as well.
