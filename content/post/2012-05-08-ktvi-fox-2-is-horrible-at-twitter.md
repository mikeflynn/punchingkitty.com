Fox 2 sucks at Twitter. We know this not because we follow @fox2now, we know this because we found, and now love, <a href="http://fox2nowpoetry.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">fox2nowpoetry.tumblr.com</a>.

Who would have thought Fox2 would be bad at Twitter? Fox 2, KTVI, is/was the <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/01/fox2s-web-center-is-apparently-a-closet-with-a-computer-in-it/" target="_blank">home of the famed &#8220;Web Center&#8221;</a>, but they screw up headline tweets like nobody&#8217;s business. You may think Tweeting out new headlines with a link to the story sounds simple to do manually, or even something one could automate very easily, but here we are with mangled headline tweets such as:

> Both St. Louis city [bit.ly/JjhhwL][1] <a title="#FOX2Now" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23FOX2Now" rel="tag">#FOX2Now</a> <a title="#STL" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23STL" rel="tag">#STL</a>

Helpful. Obviously that means:

> _Both St. Louis city_ and county have cancelled their monthly tornado warning tests for today because of incliment [sic] weather.

&#8230;but it could also mean &#8220;_Both St. Louis city_ and your mom have a lot in common because the north side is baren, the east side is a mess and you&#8217;re not sure how the hell they are producing their own special cheese in such large quantities.&#8221; Scary part: That&#8217;s actually a &#8220;good&#8221; one. They get worse when the headline nub could be considered a complete sentence. For example (yes, these are all real):

> CIA thwarted an underwear [bit.ly/JMBs1z][2] <a title="#FOX2Now" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23FOX2Now" rel="tag">#FOX2Now</a> <a title="#STL" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23STL" rel="tag">#STL</a>

We &#8220;thwarted&#8221; our underwear once too. Luckily we got to a bathroom quickly and then headed home for a &#8220;debriefing&#8221;&#8230;well actually all the thwarting and de_brief_ing happend in that PF Chang&#8217;s bathroom, but you get the picture.

> Brentwood Police Launch Facebook [bit.ly/LxTlY2][3] <a title="#FOX2Now" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23FOX2Now" rel="tag">#FOX2Now</a><a title="#STL" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23STL" rel="tag">#STL</a>

Good for them. All this time Harvard was in Brentwood huh?

> Kids Graduate [bit.ly/L9DYoI][4] <a title="#FOX2Now" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23FOX2Now" rel="tag">#FOX2Now</a> <a title="#STL" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23STL" rel="tag">#STL</a>

This must be a story about the County.

> Overland Police investigate child [bit.ly/KhqQi4][5] <a title="#FOX2Now" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23FOX2Now" rel="tag">#FOX2Now</a> <a title="#STL" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23STL" rel="tag">#STL</a>

Sounds dangerous.

There&#8217;s more than just these. There&#8217;s lots more and Fox 2 keeps churning them out (three from yesterday alone) and Erica Smith (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ericasmith" target="_blank">@ericasmith</a>) keeps posting them to <a href="http://fox2nowpoetry.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">fox2nowpoetry.tumblr.com</a>.

> Fellow Twitter users were openly mocking the 4-word tweets @fox2now was sending &#8212; and I admit, I was one of them. We were being ignored on Twitter, so I took it to the next logical step: Tumblr.

If you&#8217;re wondering what comes after Tumblr in web parody escalation, it&#8217;s a Facebook application, and then after that it&#8217;s a MySpace page for some reason&#8230;maybe this unwritten list should be updated more often.

Erica says the tweet that launched the Tumblr blog was when Fox2 claimed that <a href="http://fox2nowpoetry.tumblr.com/post/22276185279/webster-university-cancels-evening-bit-ly-juqeuh" target="_blank">Webster University had the power and balls to cancel a whole evening for everyone</a>. Since then it&#8217;s been waiting for the next stupid <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fox2now" target="_blank">@Fox2now</a> tweet, but it seems Fox 2 may have caught on to her little game yesterday:

> It appears @fox2now has fixed its Twitterfeed problem. It&#8217;s still #BadRSStoTwitter, but now with longer tweets and more ellipses.

Aww, bummer. We&#8217;ll never forget about that time the &#8220;CIA Thwarted an Underwear&#8221; though, and come on, it&#8217;s Fox &#8220;the web center&#8221; 2 we&#8217;re talking about! There will be more stupid in the weeks ahead and Erica will be there waiting with the &#8220;Create a Tumblr&#8221; page loaded in a tab at the ready.
