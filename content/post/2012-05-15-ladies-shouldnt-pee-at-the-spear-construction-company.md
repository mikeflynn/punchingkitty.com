_Updated below with an anonymous response._

The owner of the Crestwood construction company is in trouble after it was discovered he had wired up a hidden camera in the ladies room. A woman employee is obviously pretty &#8220;pissed&#8221; about it, but for any other non-employees: What you&#8217;re peeing in a construction company office? How bad did you have to go? How long were you there? Did this guy give everyone a gallon jug of water in the waiting room? Before this story, we would have estimated the number of girls peeing in a construction office to be zero. The cops were probably like &#8220;This guy&#8217;s going to jail, but next time, hold it.&#8221;

So &#8220;hidden&#8221; camera is a pretty loose term in this case. On a pipe under the sink, is just a few steps away from being on a tripod in the corner with a roll of paper towels hanging off of it.

> “What did he see? How long has it been there? What was he doing? Why was he doing this,”

&#8230;is what most of our dates probably write in their diary after they get home, but it&#8217;s also what Spear&#8217;s female employee wanted to know after finding out about the lovely little &#8220;Brian Spear joint&#8221;.

> “They’re sick. Why would someone want to see that? Why are they doing this to me?” she asked.

Ok, Devil&#8217;s Advocate here: Maybe this was nothing more than an experiment to finally solve the mystery of &#8220;Do girls poop?&#8221; Ok, we don&#8217;t want to defend the perv, but lets not just blindly throw away the tapes&#8230;can a doctor or scientist watch them and then <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080428211310AAsw9jo" target="_blank">update Yahoo Answers appropriately</a>. We can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s 2012 and no girl has yet to admit they poop. Admittedly the moon landing was probably worth figuring out first, but it&#8217;s time.

**Update, 5/15/2012 5pm:**

We received this in our anonymous tip inbox ([We love getting them! \*hint\*][1]). Naturally it&#8217;s slated a certain direction, but it seemed worth posting, because even with fart jokes, we like to cover both sides.

> LIES&#8230;.blown out of proportion by an employee wanting money. The camera was placed on the weekend only when no-one was to be there. It was even on a timer. He had a disgruntled tenant he was leasing space to who he believed was placing materials in the women&#8217;s toilet to destroy the plumbing because they were having problems with the Men&#8217;s room as well. The police found NO women on the tapes. This is why the arrest was &#8220;attempted&#8221; and Spear is not in jail.
