Our friends at [the Riverfront Times&#8217; blog STLog broke the news][1] that channel 4, KMOV, have dropped the hammer on yet another employee.  This time it was veteran of 13 years John Mills.

John left a note to his&#8230;fans? &#8230;I guess&#8230;[on his website][2]:

> <p class="paragraph_style">
>   <span class="style_1">&#8220;I am deeply grateful to the people of St. Louis for all their support over the past 13 years.<br /> </span>
> </p>

> <p class="paragraph_style">
>   &#8220;Most especially, I want to recognize the victims of crime, discrimination and natural disaster. Thank you for trusting me to share your personal, painful stories with the public during some of the most difficult times of your lives.
> </p>

<p class="paragraph_style">
  Mills closes with (emphasis mine)&#8230;
</p>

> <p class="paragraph_style">
>   &#8220;I have also enjoyed celebrating with you during many good times &#8211; the Cardinals winning the World Series, the Rams winning the Super Bowl <strong>and this great city&#8217;s continuing transformation for the better.</strong>

  Ah, thats why he was fired!  He&#8217;s a drunk&#8230;or high or something.  We at Punching Kitty.com hope John can get and stay clean.
