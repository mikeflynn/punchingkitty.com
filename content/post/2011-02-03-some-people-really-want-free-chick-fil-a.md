This morning at 6am a new Chick-Fil-A, the chicken-centric fast food chain, opened in Des Peres to a line of a few die-hard fans that camped out last night, in the bitter cold, to be among the first to enter theÂ restaurant. This is all the proof we need that fast food rots your brain.

> A group of four college-age students from Arnold showed up outside the store at 5 this morning with a tent to be the first in line. The first 100 people in line when the store opens receive 52 certificates for free meals.

Ok, so they were trying to get a free Chick-Fil-A meal a week for a whole year. Still crazy. What is a standard meal there? $8? So they stand to gain $416 dollars in fast food? What a deal! All you have to do is get frost bite while sleeping in your tent located in the middle of a Des Peres parking lot.

> &#8220;People have to use their best judgment. We certainly want customers to choose safety first, but for those who want to make it and want to have big party tonight, they are certainly welcome.&#8221;

Lining up over 24 hours ahead of time to get free fried chicken is the kind of thing that makes people hate America and the midwest. Don&#8217;t worry about it, carry on, but just something to think about later on in the day when you&#8217;re mentally frisking the nice man wearing the turbin in Wal-Mart&#8217;s electronics section.
