  Albert &#8220;Stop Calling My El Hombre&#8221; Pujols finally got on a Got Milk ad. Apparently being the best player in a major sport doesn&#8217;t qualify you ahead of a bunch of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=got+milk+ads&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=BeiqS6zcIoyqNumtxKoB&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBwQsAQwAA" target="_blank">crappy musicians, actors</a> and<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gotmilk.jpeg" target="_blank"> a guy that beat the hell out of his</a> <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/?attachment_id=3709" target="_blank">girlfriend</a>. In fact we here are loving the irony of how bad ass Pujols&#8217; Got Milk ad is in comparison to Chris Brown&#8217;s&#8230;ahem&#8230;less bad ass ad.

  Another thing we are wondering, did they do the whole &#8220;Pujols&#8217; eyes follow you where ever you go&#8221; thing on purpose to intimidate me in to drinking milk? It&#8217;s totally working. Just saying.
