> The current ordinance says on lots less than two acres, grass cannot exceed eight inches.  But on some commercial lots, it may be getting longer than that.
> 
> The city council of O’Fallon is going to take a look at making the restrictions much tighter.

In our mind&#8217;s eye, Feldman did this interview while wearing one of those little brown fedoras with a press pass tucked in to the band while scribbling away on a little note pad. There weren&#8217;t any photos with the story, and we&#8217;d like to think that&#8217;s only because he forgot all his flash powder or that the his interviewee didn&#8217;t have 15 minutes to stand still for the photo to correctly develop.

We aren&#8217;t sure why we want Brian Feldman to report news like a 1930&#8217;s Jimmy Olsen, but it sure as hell would at least liven up a story about grass height in O&#8217;Fallon, MO a touch.
