A guy robs a Clayton bank by slipping the teller a note and grabbing a sack of money (I&#8217;m assuming it was one of those with a dollar sign on it).  He then proceeds to walk across the street, in broad daylight, with tons of witnesses.  He was followed by the cops and was arrested on the first floor of the hospital with little trouble.

What?

From <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/st-louis-crime-beat/2010/02/01/clayton-bank-robber-doesnt-get-far/" target="_blank">STLToday</a>:

> The 39-year-old St. Louis man presented a note to the bank teller demanding money about 12:05 p.m. today. He did not display a weapon and no one was hurt during the robbery, Clayton police said.
> 
> Bank employees watched the man walk across the street toward the hospital complex, and Clayton and Richmond Heights police officers responded to the area.
> 
> A Richmond Heights officer arrested the man in a first-floor hospital corridor without incident. He had the stolen money with him.

Told ya!

Clearly the obvious joke here is something about the cost of health care, but that&#8217;s lame.

Feel free to pick one of the following punch lines. It&#8217;ll be like a Choose Your Own Adventure book!

1.  The hospital was out of toilet paper.

2. You wouldn&#8217;t believe how expensive a Mr Goodbar is in the Clayon vending machines.

3. I don&#8217;t blame him, its murder to remember where you parked over there.

4. The Space Vampire got you.  You are dead.
