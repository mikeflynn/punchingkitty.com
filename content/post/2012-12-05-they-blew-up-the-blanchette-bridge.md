The horrible countdown aside, this is some pretty solid video of the demolition of the Blanchette Bridge:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/SfJV-GYau8o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

The bridge was a mess, far too narrow and it clearly needed to go. However it&#8217;s still sad to think of all the people from O&#8217;Fallon, Lake St. Louis and Wentzville having to start their life over in Chesterfield after driving over the bridge to visit the mall, unaware they will never be able to return to their home that they tell people is &#8220;in the St. Louis area&#8221; while most people are like &#8220;&#8230;kinda. I mean, not really. It kinda _feels_ like you&#8217;re getting close to St. Louis while driving though but you&#8217;ve still got like 45 minutes&#8230;actually should we stop and pee? Ugh, we&#8217;re so close we don&#8217;t want to stop, but what if there&#8217;s traffic at 270? Do I have any bottles in the car as a backup plan? I thought I had one back here from the other day&#8230;and I just passed the exit! Shit.&#8221;, again.
