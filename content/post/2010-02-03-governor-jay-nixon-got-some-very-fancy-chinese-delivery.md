From the <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/feb/02/nixon-meets-chinese-ambassador-state-capital/" target="_blank">Globe Democrat</a>:

> Despite recent tensions between the U.S. and China, the governor warmly received China&#8217;s ambassador to the U.S. at a discussion of a trade partnership marked by little tangible progress.
> 
> The two officials are looking to make Lambert Airport in St. Louis the Midwestern hub of air cargo transport between China and the U.S., but did not provide specifics or expand upon previous announcements.

So you&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s a good chance I might be able to get a straight flight from St. Louis to China, but I have to make two layovers to get to New York?
