That menacing looking fellow above is Kyle Watson, a Brazillan Jiu-Jitsu instructor, who has earned one of the 28 spots on Spike TV&#8217;s _The Ultimate Fighter_ reality show. _The Ultimate Fighter_ sounded like a odd name for a show about filming gay porn but then someone told us that actually those gentlemen rolling around in nothing but tiny shorts don&#8217;t love each other, but rather are in a fight.

The 11th season of Spike TV&#8217;s angst-ridden reality show starts on September 15th at 7pm. We&#8217;re guessing it will be followed by a Star Wars or James Bond marathon interspersed with commercials involving beer, hot chicks, explosions and penises&#8230;whoops! We&#8217;ve been told the penises are are simply implied by all the overly agressive manliness. We get it Spike! You&#8217;re really really manly. Take it down a notch though ok princess?
