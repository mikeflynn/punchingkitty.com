(No, no, no&#8230;not _you_. Your tweets are great! We&#8217;re talking about the _other_ people.)

#hoesthesedays, #brokehoes, #brokeniggas, #friendsthatfuck? Has St. Louis&#8217; twitter population always been the embodiment of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si07Jdzn_4I" target="_blank">Seth Green&#8217;s character from <em>Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait</em></a> or is this a recent thing over our last two week vacation?

We don&#8217;t know the exact number of suburban white kids getting all comfy in their new social network home away from MySpace to tweet &#8220;#niggasthesedays&#8221; needed to make the term &#8220;trend&#8221;, but we&#8217;re guessing it&#8217;s more than a few.

Oh wait, there&#8217;s still more horribleness! Not only does St. Louis apparently have an issue with broke &#8220;hoes&#8221; and &#8220;niggas&#8221; on Twitter, but we also seem to have horrible taste in sports reporters:

We kinda wanna just go with a reason of &#8220;unicorn magic&#8221;, but unofficially label this one as unsolved.
