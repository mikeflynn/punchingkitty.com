A Belleville woman fought off an attacker that came up from behind her while jogging, pulled down her pants and jumped on top of her. He was going to go with flowers, but thought it seemed to cliche.

> &#8220;Fortunately, she was able to fight him off enough, get up, get her wits together and took off running,&#8221; said Captain Don Sax with the Belleville Police Department said. &#8220;She began screaming as she was leaving and fortunately there was some other people on the trail that were on bicycles that were coming towards her so she ran towards them, they came towards her.&#8221;

Unfortunately the attacker got away while the woman was fleeing and police are looking for any information they can get.

In other news, between this and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/03/15/belleville-mom-takes-a-stab-at-mother-of-the-year/" target="_blank">our other story from earlier today</a>, Belleville, Illinois seems like the most perverted, drunken, and scary place on the earth right now.  Which means East St. Louis, IL falls to number 2 on that list for the first time in over 20 years! Congratulations East St. Louis, you&#8217;ve really not earned this at all, and we&#8217;re sure it won&#8217;t last long, so fire another policeman and celebrate!
