Last night at around 7p a 16-year-old lifeguard at O&#8217;Fallon, MO&#8217;s Twin Chimneys Subdivision Pool was caught in the leg by a stray bullet.

> O&#8217;Fallon, Missouri police said the teen was hit in her upper leg while she was on the pool deck at Twin Chimneys Subdivision Pool on Sunday around 6:45 p.m.
> 
> She was treated for minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital.
> 
> Police do not know where the bullet came from, but said it could have been fired &#8220;a significant distance away&#8221; from the subdivision.

We know where it came from: Random Gunfire.

Random Gunfire, a city mainstay, as decided to move out to St. Charles County, like many before him, because of the high crime rate and poor schools. O&#8217;Fallon, MO, which was recently named as one of the &#8220;best places to live&#8221; in some list, seemed like a great place so Random Gunfire went over the weekend to check it out. How did he travel over there? You guessed it Metrolink, 2 busses and a cab. &#8220;It would have been easier to get here if MetroLink just went all the way out.&#8221; Random Gunfire claimed, solidifying all the fears of St. Charles County voters.

To be clear, no one likes Random Gunfire. He&#8217;s kind of a dick. Good luck O&#8217;Fallon! Make sure that magazine that made that list doesn&#8217;t find out or listen to our voicemail we just left about this.
