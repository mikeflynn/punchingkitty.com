In case you were wondering, the song is about being &#8220;so St. Louis&#8221;, and though it might just be a serious attempt to make an hit music video, it&#8217;s far better to view under the &#8220;lame tourism video&#8221; filter. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY" target="_blank">like this one for Cleveland</a>)

> &#8220;I could just say St. Louis over and over again, that would be cool.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I would turn your flat-billed hat a little sideways&#8230;&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Well god Carl, of course I&#8217;m going to turn my hat a little sideways, I&#8230;&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;&#8230;ok! Well I think that&#8217;s all you need.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;No, it needs something more. Something really obvious.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;More obvious than saying &#8216;St. Louis&#8217; over and over?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Yeah&#8230;wait! What if I stand in front of every building in the greater St. Louis area!&#8221;

> &#8220;Bingo.&#8221;

Now as we all know, the most crucial scene in a rap video is the party scene. Every rapper spends roughly 92% of his time at fabulous parties, so showing one of them in a video is crucial as proof to the fact of your awesome rappines. This dude did his in some condo kitchen. It&#8217;s not bad though, I think I saw a sexy lady over to the left by the hot plate:

Ok ok ok. We&#8217;ll give the guy a break he did at least manage to get the Sir-Mix-A-Lot booty shot in there, so points for that:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/09/stlouis_music_video_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6656" title="stlouis_music_video_4" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/09/stlouis_music_video_4.jpg?filter=resize&w=537" alt="" /></a>
</p>

&#8230;but if we are going to give him points for that, we will have to deduct for &#8220;making it rain&#8221; with singles:

That really seems more like &#8220;making it drizzle&#8221;.
