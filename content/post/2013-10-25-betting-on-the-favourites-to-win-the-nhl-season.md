The very latest date that the NHL season could come to an end is Wednesday 19<sup>th</sup> June. That will happen should either the winners of the Western Conference, the Chicago Blackhawks or the Eastern Conference Champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, win the first four of the seven game series. If all seven games are played, then the final will be played in Chicago on Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup> June.

It is said that winning the Staley Cup is the toughest challenge of all in team sport. It is certainly a very long haul through the regular season, through the playoffs, and ending with a seven match series against a side that is ostensibly as good as you. It is no wonder that emotions get more than a little inflamed. Had you bet on either of this year’s contenders early on, you would have done so at fairly long odds so you could be in for a welcome win, but betting on them now when there is only a very marginal favourite (Chicago Blackhawks at 10/13 is the current favourite versus Boston Bruins at 6/5) there is little to go on. You might as well just guess or toss a coin.

An alternative way of betting on ice hockey is to try out you luck and skill on the Ice Hockey themed slots game Break Away which is one of the latest ice hockey themed video slots and can be found at <a href="http://www.gamingclub.com/au" target="_blank">www.gamingclub.com/au</a>. The game has a total of 243 paylines, so there is no shortage of winning combinations on this 5 reel slot. The jackpot cash prize is $500 and the minimum bet is just $0.50; the payouts are frequent so you can enjoy hours of fun without investing too much money. There are many ice hockey animations in stunning HD and accompanied by great sound effects. There are plenty of features to keep you entertained including free spins and special bonus features.
