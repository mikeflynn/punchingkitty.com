Everyone knows that Becky, the area&#8217;s &#8220;Queen of Carpet&#8221;, has a long history of horrible commercials and if one came on right now, you&#8217;d be all like &#8220;Ugh, how has that carpet she stands on not given way and let her fall to her death yet?!&#8221; &#8230;but if we told you she uploaded all of her old commercials to YouTube, we bet  you&#8217;d spend the vast majority of your Friday watching them!

We&#8217;re not talking about the new sell-out ones where Becky&#8217;s skinny and the carpet moves side to side all fancy like. No one wants to see that. We&#8217;re talking about the old ones&#8230;the ones where Becky&#8217;s bigger than the Arch, there&#8217;s that other &#8220;Wanda&#8221; broad on the carpet and they had special guests like Steve and DC:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/xaV-u7uSkvQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

&#8230;or the one where there was a dog on the carpet that looked just as confused as the rest of us as to why Becky is in a wedding gown:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ikCjwzqJJfU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

They went in to space once:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/bubtzjOUoAE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Steve Mizerany made an apperance once and his arm action suggests he had more trouble balancing on the carpet than the ladies:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/BAMqT2N4vhA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

But nothing can match the acting and the gut-wrenching drama that unfolded when Becky was waiting for Wanda and she didn&#8217;t think she could  jump from the Arch to the carpet:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/f6hXfSUDSwI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

While we enjoyed that trip down memory lane, we&#8217;re left with a hollow feeling that only a story about two ladies that are frankly not attractive enough for us to reasonably entertain the though about trying to work in a &#8220;two girls riding each other&#8217;s carpet&#8221; joke can leave. A sad day indeed. Oh wait, we kinda did it after all. Enjoy thinking about that reference all weekend St. Louis!

&#8230;oh and because we love you here&#8217;s an unrelated Schwieg Engel ad where they cut the one guys&#8217; head off in the name of giving people credit:
