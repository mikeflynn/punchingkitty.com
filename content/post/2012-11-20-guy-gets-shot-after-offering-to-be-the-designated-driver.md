No city knows how to flip a good rule on it&#8217;s head, spit on it and kick it in the eye like St. Louis. For instance, earlier in the year we saw someone <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/07/09/new-in-st-louis-people-getting-shot-for-not-buying-drugs/" target="_blank">that &#8220;Just said no.&#8221; to drugs get shot</a>, and now we have a guy that offered someone a ride home get shot in the neck. In the freaking neck! That&#8217;s what you get for looking out for other people&#8217;s safety you dick!

> The shooting happened in Florissant where [Timothy Rogers] and the victim spent their Sunday night drinking at Olympic Lanes on New Halls Ferry.
> 
> When the victim suggested Rogers was unfit to drive home and offered to take him, police say Rogers pulled a gun and shot the would-be Good Samaritan in the throat.

Mr. Roger&#8217;s neighborhood has changed quite a bit since we were last there. This Mr. Rogers sounds like after knocking a few back he would have punched that trolly right off that little track and forced himself on all the female puppets. Sure it sounds easy to rape a puppet, and maybe you think they won&#8217;t really mind because of how they are totally wide open down there and they usually have lots of people inside them anyway but you&#8217;d be wrong. They scream just like you would&#8230;well&#8230;you have to scream for them, but if you do it in a little voice it makes it seem like they are screaming&#8230;look, it&#8217;s still a horrible sight. Don&#8217;t ask how we know, just trust us.

> The 36-year-old victim is hospitalized in stable condition following surgery.

Good. The bad news is, he&#8217;s 100% pro drunk driving now. He actually plans to stand around at bars and convince people they haven&#8217;t had enough. Hard to blame him.

**Update:** So we do a random paragraph on puppet rape and that leads to us finding a web series about a rehabilitated puppet rapist: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DD0pBgotC0" target="_blank">youtube.com/watch?v=-DD0pBgotC0</a> Thank you internet!
