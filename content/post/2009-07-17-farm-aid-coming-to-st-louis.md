Do I really need to talk about this?  What&#8217;s to talk about?  [Farm Aid][2] is coming to St. Louis, and its going to be in the horrible Verizon Wire&#8230;wait&#8230;UMB&#8230;um&#8230;Riverport.  Its coming to Riverport.

Shockingly the concert thats about helping people grow things will be fronted by none other than: Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and Dave Matthews.  [_Editor&#8217;s Note: John Mellencamp will be there too, but he didn&#8217;t fit in as well with the weed joke we had going._]

There really isn&#8217;t much else to say.
