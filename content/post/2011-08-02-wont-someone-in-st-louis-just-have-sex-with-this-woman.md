Poor girl, she just wants some lovin&#8217;. The only qualification is that you have to be a &#8220;good guy&#8221; but frankly after reading the rest of the her ad we&#8217;re pretty sure that he might even be flexible on that.

Oh and if you&#8217;re one of the zero single guys in the world that wants a random hook up to end in pregnancy? She&#8217;s cool with that too. Yea! High five bro! We can&#8217;t wait to have a pissed off 24 year old show up on our doorstep some day so we can say we found his mom on a Craigslist ad where she was &#8220;[R]eally just looking for anything.&#8221;

Very romantic.
