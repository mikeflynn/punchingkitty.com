We hear that Alderwoman **Marlene Davis** of the 19th ward is trying her damnedest to put the breaks on the [Midtown Alley][1] September 26th event.  Why?  Because she has an axe to grind with developer **Jassen Johnson** who has been renovating the &#8220;Midtown Alley&#8221; and at one point opposed Davis as she tried to get the club EXO to get a 3am liquor license.  EXO got their 3am license after all, but Davis still has her Johnson voodoo doll and she thinks that shutting down an event that, as we see it, can only help St. Louis is the best way to get back at Johnson.

Not only that but we also are hearing our friends at the **Riverfront Times** are starting a little investigation on Davis, looking to uncover what she&#8217;s been keeping in her closet next to her old beat up white granny panties.

You can email [Alderwoman Davis here][2] with your thoughts on the matter.
