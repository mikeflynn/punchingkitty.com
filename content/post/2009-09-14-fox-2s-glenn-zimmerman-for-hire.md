Straight from [Glenn&#8217;s site][1]:

> Here&#8217;s the deal &#8212; the economy is in the dumps and a lot of businesses are urging employees to take furlough weeks

> THAT&#8217;S RIGHT&#8230;I AM FOR HIRE! I have 5 days off&#8230;October 12th through the 16th. Is there something I can do for your business? I am looking for an honest day&#8217;s work for an honest day&#8217;s wage&#8230;

According to his schedule, he is already nearly booked up!  So if you want Glenn Zimmerman to help insert suppositories at the old folks home because he said it _wasn&#8217;t_ going to rain on your wedding day, here&#8217;s your chance.

In fact, here are a few ideas from us, for free, on what you could make Glenn Zimmerman do.

1. Make him stand in the back ground of Show Me St. Louis, loudly telling everyone the current tempature.

2. Ladies, have him spank you, just once, so when you see him on TV in a bar,  you can just turn to the person next to you and say &#8220;See him?  He spanked me one time.&#8221;

3. Don&#8217;t you think St. Louis should have their own [Naked Cowboy][2]?

Let us know if you use any of our ideas, or if you see Glenn out snap a photo and send it this way!
