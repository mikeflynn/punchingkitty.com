You think this place is crazy?! Dude. Nothing like my town.&#8221; Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun if someone ruined all those arguments by making up random data points and then ranking the cities accordingly?

**The Daily Beast** <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-03-11/americas-25-craziest-cities/full/" target="_blank">did just that</a>.  We didn&#8217;t win.

St. Louis came in at #21 with 20 psychiatrists per capita, a stress score\* of 23, a 34 on eccentricity\*, a drinking rating* of 22 and the following comment:

> Despite Missouri’s generally lenient open-container laws (read: there aren’t many), it is <a href="http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/missouri" target="_blank">illegal</a> on the curb of any city street to drink beer from a bucket.

Our cross-town retarded brother we don&#8217;t talk about but won&#8217;t leave us alone, Kansas City came in just after us at #23 overall.

A selection of other cities and their scores:

#5 Las Vegas

#17 Portland

#26 Chicago

#41 Detroit

#46 Atlanta

#57 Salt Lake City
