If you noticed a distinct lack of &#8220;sports&#8221; talk that is 8 parts gay jokes and 2 parts Mizzou talk, its probably because your only choice for sports talk was **101ESPN**&#8216;sÂ _Mike & Mike in the Morning_ after Monday night&#8217;s storm kicked over the flattened out coat hanger **590 AM KFNS** uses to broadcast.

The morning static was confirmed by the station&#8217;s morning show host, **Tim McKernan**&#8230;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7540" title="tmckernan_kfns_tweet" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/tmckernan_kfns_tweet.png" alt="" width="521" height="253" />][1]McKernan, who&#8217;s InsideSTL.com handles most of the day&#8217;s programming on KFNS, did their show through the internets until the station came back on line a few hours later.

KFNS themselves however, decided to pretend none of this happened, or realizes that no one cares about losing one of the many &#8220;sports talk&#8221; station in the city for a few hours since there was nary a mention on their site, <a href="http://www.kfns.com/kfnsindex.aspx" target="_blank">KFNS.com</a> or their <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/590thefanKFNS" target="_blank">Twitter profile</a> as of this writing.

Meanwhile the folks at KFNS sister station **KSLG 1380** remained on the air so that the homeless guy sitting outside the 1380 offices on the Landing could get somewhat clear audio of&#8230;you know, we have no idea what&#8217;s on that station. Not even enough for a joke. Did they go out too? Not really sure. There are CB radio conversations that have more listeners.
