You may have recently heard that [Sedalia&#8217;s School District is run by spineless morons][1], well stories that stupid tend to grow legs on the internet and [according to The Riverfront Times][2], the little T-Shirt Shop that created the shirt is now overrun with orders for the banned nerd-art.

> Last week one of the owners of the shop told the RFT&#8217;s sister paper in Kansas City that the T-shirts have sold like hot cakes thanks to the online popularity of the ban.
> 
> We&#8217;re just getting too many requests,&#8221; says Jack Lewis, who co-owns Main Street with Mike Ingram. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting them from foreign countries, about all the states.&#8221;

Its things like this that renew my faith in humanity.

Dammit. Â Now we want one too.
