No these aren&#8217;t shots of a weird scene from The Office where the Erin marries Dwight, this is real.

The Office and Bridesmaid star, as well as Missouri native, Ellie Kemper got married last weekend to her dorky looking husband seen above. Thats right guys, we all could have gotten down with that because if that guy can do it you&#8217;re chances would have been just as good. Seriously, have you ever seen a head more perfect for a swirlie?

Of course Ellie looked great and as would be expected, her friends were all there including Kristen Wig with The Strokes&#8217; Fabrizio Moretti, Mindy Kaling and Kristen Schaal who&#8217;s that girl on **30 Rock** that always looks like she&#8217;s caught in that moment right before you sneeze:
