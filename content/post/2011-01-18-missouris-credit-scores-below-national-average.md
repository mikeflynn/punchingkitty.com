In rather unsurprising news today we learned that Missouri&#8217;s credit scores are below the national average by ten points.

> Bruce McClary with Clear Point Credit Counseling Solutions said Missouri residents on average are about ten points below the rest of the country receiving an average score of 658.
> 
> With lower scores, it will cost more to borrow money.  McClary said someone with a credit score of **658** will pay about $140 more per month on a mortgage.

With &#8220;good&#8221; scores starting in the 730 to 740 range, Missouri isn&#8217;t a group of people we&#8217;d lend any money too. Plus you&#8217;ll just end up spending it on meth or guns.

This is where we were going to put up a screen grab from that &#8220;free credit score&#8221; scam commercial with the three guy and one of them is a fat ugly guy with a low score screwing everything up with an arrow pointing to him saying he&#8217;s Missouri. Like so:

It&#8217;s a full 25 points _higher_ than Missouri&#8217;s average score! That&#8217;s supposed to be the one ruining this guy&#8217;s chances to get a new car! &#8230;suddenly the old post on the home-made <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/05/st-louisan-makes-the-very-first-ford-escort-truck" target="_blank">Ford Escape Truck</a> is coming in to focus.

If you were wondering, Massachusetts and New Jersey have the best average score, both coming in at 686.
