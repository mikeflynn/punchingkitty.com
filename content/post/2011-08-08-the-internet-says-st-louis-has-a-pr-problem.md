There are all kinds of wonderful uses for the internet! To just name a few off the top of our head, there&#8217;s porn, midget porn, banner ads that have playable games, amputee porn, Wikipedia, <a href="http://twitter.com/mayorslay" target="_blank">the Mayor&#8217;s Twitter stream</a>, and of course, Disney character porn (we both know you want to, but please don&#8217;t search for that until you&#8217;re home from work tonight). Over the weekend we found one more thing for that list: Asking random people questions.

<a href="http://omegle.com" target="_blank">Omegle.com</a> is a site, much like the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatroulette" target="_blank">Chatroulette</a>, where you are simply auto-paired with another random user for a chat over video or text, but they are beta testing a new feature where one can ask a question, any question, and have two strangers debate the answer. After spending far too long asking questions like &#8220;Who likes boobies?!&#8221;, &#8220;Who let the dogs out?&#8221; and &#8220;What what in the \___?&#8221;, we got down to business and decided to ask John Q. Internet what they knew about our fair city. A St. Louis public relations spot check if you will. Here is a sampling of our results:

Classy. What are the odds we&#8217;d get someone from Kansas City on the first try?!

Well&#8230;um&#8230;actually this is&#8230;uh&#8230;ok, we&#8217;ve got nothing. It is what it is. Enjoy.

Yes, Pujols! Finally! Reactions like this makes you wonder if the Mayor&#8217;s quietly drumming up support for a Pujols tax to keep the one guy people know from St. Louis around after this season. If not, we might have to check on <a href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/Louis" target="_blank">Louis from the video game Left 4 Dead</a>&#8216;s availability and skills with a first basemen&#8217;s mitt.

We can see the new tourism campaign now: &#8220;St. Louis: Your mom and the Arch&#8230;maybe.&#8221;

Time to get to work St. Louis! No one knows a damn thing about you! The silver lining is that people clearly don&#8217;t remember which city is probably leading the nation in &#8220;rusty knife stabbings for less than $20&#8221; according to a recent magazine/paper/blog that scraped another top/bottom list our of the shitty idea bowl, so now&#8217;s our chance! Get out there and start PR-ing your ass off St. Louis! Oh and maybe it&#8217;s time for a new tourism video, because this last one we put out there is kind of a downer, and we aren&#8217;t really vibing on the acid trip down Sesame Street aesthetic.
