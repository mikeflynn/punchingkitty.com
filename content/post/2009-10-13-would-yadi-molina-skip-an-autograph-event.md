Would our big eared Yadi skip out on an event he was already paid to do?  Who knows, but we think a lawsuit like this is probably initiated because they have some pretty solid evidence.

It always amazes us when athletes or celebs do this kind of thing.  Do you think they won&#8217;t be able to find you?  The whole reason you got the gig is because people know who you are!  &#8230;I guess 175,00 isn&#8217;t all that much when you are a ballplayer, but still, isn&#8217;t really more about just not being a douche?
