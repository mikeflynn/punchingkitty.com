> The [River City] casino opened after a parade and ceremonies where St. Louis Cardinals&#8217; baseball Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith pulled a lever on an oversized slot machine to officially open the doors. The 90,000 square foot casino game floor features more than 2,000 slot machines and 55 table games.

The odd thing with non-Las Vegas casinos is that they are pretty much old folks home that serve drinks to young people at night.  Come to think of it, even the Vegas casinos are kinda like that, but they are so crazy you can&#8217;t tell as much.

Think I&#8217;m wrong?  The grand opening of a casino was at 2pm on a Thursday.

2:00pm in the middle of a work day.

Yeah, I bet all kinds of young people and businessmen came flocking out for that ribbon cutting.

Not only that, but I bet like all casinos, they keep it cold as hell in there&#8230;kinda like they are trying to perserve something&#8230;a casino like this in Lemay, Missouri might as well just cut the crap and start pumping in formaldehyde in through the vents.
