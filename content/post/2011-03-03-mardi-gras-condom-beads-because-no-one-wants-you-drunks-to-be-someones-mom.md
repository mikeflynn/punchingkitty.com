Why? Because you&#8217;re all skanky.

> [Teresa Parker, owner,] said she decided to participate in handing out the beads because she wants to promote safe sex and thought it was a good theme with the adult band, Digger&#8217;s Lounge, playing this weekend.
> 
> The condom wrapper says &#8220;Catch these not STDs&#8221; and includes a phone number for testing.

Good idea&#8230;but alas, no one&#8217;s going to use them. You&#8217;ll find them over every door handle though, and the street will be littered with popped condom balloons. One of those condoms, stuck to the end of beads being thrown around as boob currency by drunks, has less of a chance to see a penis this weekend than Ellen Degeneres.

Next year, shoot for &#8220;morning after pill beads&#8221;. _Those_ might make a difference.
