It&#8217;s Friday and we have some more posts coming up later in the day, but first lets recap. Do this next line in your best TV announcer internal voice.

_Previously on Punching Kitty&#8230;_

As we&#8217;re sure you know, as of Monday we randomly decided this would be &#8220;animated gif week&#8221; here on Punching Kitty&#8230;and then somewhere around Wednesday we decided it should be &#8220;animated gif week (but only use ones we made)&#8221; after we used 90&#8217;s teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek to illustrate some White People Problems:

It&#8217;s funny, but we didn&#8217;t make it. We _did_ make Monday&#8217;s gif though from the now infamous Ray Vinson local Super Bowl commercial:

On Wednesday, we reviewed the indie flick &#8220;Love Stalker&#8221;, and made one especially for them with a small chunk of their movie:

It&#8217;s so real it&#8217;s like Del Taco never left and you can still smell the blood, rancid meat and semen!

Finally, for Thursday, we dipped in to our archives to create the &#8220;KMOV News Busters&#8221; gif:

So what&#8217;s today&#8217;s gif? Well, since it&#8217;s the final day of Animated GIF week here at Punching Kitty, we&#8217;re going to blow it out! We have three brand new, St. Louis GIFs for you! &#8230;and you&#8217;re going to have to wait until later in the day to see them, because we&#8217;re going to be dicks and post them separately a various times so you have to keep coming back! You don&#8217;t have to leave though. Instead you can just hang out, read the archives and maybe click an ad or two. Oh but don&#8217;t go in to our all white living room with the comfy looking couch. That&#8217;s just for lookin&#8217; at, not for sittin&#8217;.
