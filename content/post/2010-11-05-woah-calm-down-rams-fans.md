  <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/11/sad_rams_fans.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7766" title="sad_rams_fans" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/11/sad_rams_fans.jpeg?filter=resize&w=600" alt="" /></a>Here we were thinking a 4 &#8211; 4 team was pretty good after only managing 3 wins the last two years, but if you look at the faces in this picture of the stands during a recent game our tipster alerted us too you would think these people were watching an episode of <strong>NCIS</strong>. Freaking horrible show. Mark Harmon?! Really, you made a show staring Mark Harmon? We&#8217;ve gotten better performances from the parking lot guy that asks for &#8220;just a couple of bucks, whatever you&#8217;ve got on you&#8221; every day, or the guy that keeps handing us envelopes with &#8220;restraining orders&#8221; in them. Shame on you CBS, and shame on you Katy Perry. That show is horrible and these &#8220;stop or I&#8217;m calling the police&#8221; jokes are getting old. We both know we have a connection, please write back with your own blood sampleÂ enclosed. I can&#8217;t make our matching lockets without it!

  Shame. On. You. Both.
