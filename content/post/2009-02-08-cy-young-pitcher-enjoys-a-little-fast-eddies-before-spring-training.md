We hear Cy Young winning pitcher and White Sox ace, [Mark Buehrle][1], was over at Fast Eddie&#8217;s yesterday.  

Buehrle is from the St. Louis area (he graduated from Francis Howell North) and his family still lives in town, so this is of little surprise, but its just nice to hear he gets back to the area in the offseason and partakes in some of the local favorites even after hitting the big time.
