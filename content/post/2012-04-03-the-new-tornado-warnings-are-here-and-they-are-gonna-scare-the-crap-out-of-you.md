While it&#8217;s been well known to everyone for some time is that people, in general, ignore tornado warning sirens. They go off and people don&#8217;t listen, can&#8217;t hear them or just wish they&#8217;d stop so that they can continue their mugging without interruption. Weather people just found out though, and so as of today they are introducing a new warning system that they think will make people realize when a tornado is small, or a tornado is of Joplin-destroying magnitude.

> [S]tarting today if it looks like a tornado will be severe there will be a new kind of warning. The warnings will include terms such as &#8220;mass devastation&#8221;, &#8220;unsurvivable&#8221; or &#8220;catastrophic.&#8221;
> 
> So here&#8217;s a warning you might hear from 4Warn Storm Team members Steve Templeton (Chief Meteorologist), Matt Chambers, Kent Ehrhardt or Kristen Cornett:  &#8220;THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TORNADO WITH COMPLETE DEVASTATION LIKELY. … SEEK SHELTER NOW! … MOBILE HOMES AND OUTBUILDINGS WILL OFFER NO SHELTER FROM THIS TORNADO &#8211; ABANDON THEM IMMEDIATELY.&#8221;

One obvious issue is that in some areas the words &#8220;devastation&#8221; or &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; might not be fully understood and then quickly used as baby names. In those areas, the warnings will be tweaked to the following: Instead of &#8220;unsurvivable&#8221;, it will be &#8220;You dead.&#8221; Instead of &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; it will be &#8220;You crazy?! You know you betta run bitch!&#8221; and instead of &#8220;mass devastation&#8221; it will be &#8220;Remember when cousin Uncle Leroy ate up all them beans then got drunk and missed to toilet? This whole place is gonna be like Aunt Sarah&#8217;s bathroom.&#8221;
