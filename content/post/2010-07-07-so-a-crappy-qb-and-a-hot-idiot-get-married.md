I mean, if you don&#8217;t count horse teeth, dark roots or pre-mature smile lines.

> The onetime beauty queen turned same-sex marriage opponent had a wedding of her own Friday night, swapping vows with NFL stud Kyle Boller in a lavish ceremony in San Diego.
> 
> The Oakland Raiders quarterback and Prejean said their &#8220;I do&#8217;s&#8221; at Capella Church, located inside the Grand Del Mar Hotel in the bride&#8217;s beachy California hometown, in a 25-minute ceremony surrounded by friends and family.
> 
> &#8220;It was beautiful,&#8221; an eyewitness exclusively tells E! News. &#8220;They had cocktails on the lawn right after. Everyone seemed really happy.&#8221;

Yup, everyone was really happy. Right up until they figured out the planner, the catering chef and half the waitstaff were all gay and had been depositing some of their objections to this marriage in the Alfredo sauce all night.
