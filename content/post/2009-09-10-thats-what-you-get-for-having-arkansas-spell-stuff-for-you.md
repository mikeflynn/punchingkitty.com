Notice anything particularly stupid about our shiny new ambulances?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1664" title="ambulance_opt" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ambulance_opt.jpg" alt="ambulance_opt" width="362" height="252" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/ambulance_opt.jpg 362w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/ambulance_opt-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" />If you didn&#8217;t, you must be from Arkansas, which is the same place they got these from.

From [Deb Peterson&#8217;s blog post][1]:

> Bill Greenblatt, photographer about town, was on hand when some new ambulances that had been lettered in Arkansas were delivered to the St. Louis Fire Department headquarters downtown.

So now they have to get them fixed.  Eh, they&#8217;ll just take some money from the education budget.   No matter how much they take, we won&#8217;t be dead last in _edu-ma-cation_ right Arkansas?!
