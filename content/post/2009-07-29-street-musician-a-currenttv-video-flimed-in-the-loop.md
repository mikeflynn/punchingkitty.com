This is a little old being as it was posted in October of last year, but I just ran across it today and its a great little piece shot in the Loop about a street musician named Bryson Gerard. Â I know I&#8217;ve seen this guy sitting in front of Vintage Vinyl from time to time, and I&#8217;m guessing many of you have too.
