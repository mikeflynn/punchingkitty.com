He helped them out. Lets all congratulate Wiley on winning the &#8220;Way to Not Be A Dick! What Do You Want a Cookie Now?!&#8221; Award that KSDK is intent on giving him.

Lets run <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/watercooler/story.aspx?storyid=213612&catid=71" target="_blank">KSDK&#8217;s &#8220;story&#8221; about the amazing events</a> through our translate-o-tron 3000 here at Punching Kitty HQ:

> It&#8217;s not really news,

Good, we agree on something.

> &#8230;but we wanted to applaud the work of our colleague, reporter Frank Wiley.

We filmed it too. Our boss hopes this is a tax write-off.

> Frank took time from his hectic day to rush to the aid of a woman in a Manchester neighborhood who had a flat tire on her SUV.

Frank wasn&#8217;t an asshole and helped a completely non-threatening soccer mom with a flat tire. He jumped over 10 line-up homeless guys to &#8220;rush to her aid&#8221; too! It was amazing!

> Even though he was wearing a dress shirt and tie, Frank wasn&#8217;t afraid to roll up his sleeves and get a little dirty to help the woman get her tire changed and be on her way.

By that we mean he literally rolled up his sleeves. It&#8217;s not a euphemism for something much more difficult. All he really did was roll his sleeves up.

> Way to go Frank!

God August is boring.
