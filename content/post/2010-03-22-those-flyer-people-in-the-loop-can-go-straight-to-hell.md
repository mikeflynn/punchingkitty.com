&#8220;Crap. They&#8217;re back.&#8221;

&#8220;Who?&#8221;

&#8220;Come see.&#8221;

The two of them stand up and look in to the window facing the parking lot, each of them looking through their reflections, focusing on their respective cars.

&#8220;They didn&#8217;t get mine yet.&#8221;

&#8220;Well the bastards got mine double and their heading your direction.&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll miss it.&#8221;

The crowd at the window has now grown to 6.

&#8220;Can someone set off their alarm? That would freak them out.&#8221;

&#8220;Could we call the cops for something like this?  It has to be some form of littering.&#8221;

&#8220;Well the cops just drove by and they sure didn&#8217;t seem to give a shit.&#8221;

&#8220;No! No no no no no&#8230;damn. They got my car now too.&#8221;

There are lots of reasons parking in the Loop sucks. On a particularly nice Friday, just finding a spot is nightmarish enough, then you have to worry about whose going to take a poke at  you on your way to Blueberry Hill.  Once you get there and settle in to your booth, yet another annoyance is hard at work: **Those damn flyer people.**

They would say they are serving a valuable purpose. Who else would tell you which washed up reality start is &#8220;hosting&#8221; a party at Home Nightclub next week?!  We would say their &#8220;service&#8221; of making random high school drop-outs walk around and plaster crap all of our cars that no one cares about and will most certainly end up on the ground isn&#8217;t serving anyone but yourselves. We&#8217;ve tried really hard, but no matter how much we think about this problem, we still have three nagging questions.

**1. Who are these people?**

Who are these people that take a job that involves spreading crap around your own town? &#8230;a job that can&#8217;t pay much more than $.25/hour. Also, why aren&#8217;t these people smart enough to just trash the whole pile of flyers, take a long lunch, come back and say &#8220;All done!&#8221;

**2. This can&#8217;t be a very successful advertising method&#8230;can it?**

How often can this work as a successful advertisement method? Admittedly when you pay next to nothing for your base costs, even a 1% success rate is a win, but still. Also, how can your success rate even be proven? I rarely see any identification-type info so that the band or whatever knows I came from a flyer stuck to my car.  Are people just going to up businesses (Home Nightclub) and saying &#8220;Hey, give me a bunch of money and I&#8217;ll pay my army of homeless people to put them all over cars in the Loop. I can&#8217;t prove that it works, but trust me.&#8221; &#8230;and people (Home Nightclub) buy this load of crap?!

**3. Shouldn&#8217;t this be illegal?**

The disgusting legal irony of this is that while its clearly not illegal for them to stick little pieces of paper all over my car, if a cop sees me take off and throw it on the ground I&#8217;m the one that gets a littering ticket!  This practice basically makes paper to basically turn it directly into litter. It&#8217;s amazing.

Long story short: Screw you flyer people.
