A Wentzville tatto shop owner is facing gun and drug charges, which is a total bummer since he&#8217;s already in trouble for getting caught video taping women in his shop&#8217;s bathroom. The real shame of all of this is the lost of trust, because if you can&#8217;t trust your small town creepy tattoo artist to not shoot you or videotape you in the horrible little bathroom, then what do you have in this world?!

> Court documents say that when a customer told him she wanted a piercing removed from her belly, he pulled out a hand gun and told her that &#8220;this would remove it.&#8221;

If we were that lady, we&#8217;d be less worried about this chosen piercing removal tools and more concerned about his little squinty eyes. Look at those things! They&#8217;re barely bigger than his nostrils! How is this guy tattooing anything correctly, let alone shooting off belly piercings? Maybe that&#8217;s why she wanted it remved to begin with, we hear belly piercings are more sexy and easier to remove yourself, when they aren&#8217;t 5 inches off center.
