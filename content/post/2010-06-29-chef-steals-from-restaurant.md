All of them.

Not you though. The _rest_ of them.

One beer? Bastard broke in to his old work place, to steal one hell of a bar-b-q and didn&#8217;t even get us a beer? Freaking weak. Everyone knows that when you go get yourself a beer, you say &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m getting a beer. Everyone cool?&#8221; and take a quick survey. Didn&#8217;t hear a peep from you bro. Lame.

What do you think about the crap this guy&#8217;s pulling John Pertzborn?
