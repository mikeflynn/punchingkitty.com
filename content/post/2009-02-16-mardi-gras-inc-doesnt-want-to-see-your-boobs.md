[The RFT&#8217;s STLog][1] has the list of fineable situations put out by Mardi Gras Inc.  Some of the highlights: 

  * Music too loud or in disabonmernt&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.$250
  * Unapproved throws&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.$100
  * Lewd behavior / Nudity&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..$250

So no boobies at Mardi Gras.  Sounds like fun. Of course the interesting thing is that this is not a list from the STL PD, this is from Mardi Gras Inc.  so I&#8217;m interested to see how this goes down when a fine needs to be dealt.

Another thing: &#8220;Unapproved throws?&#8221;  what the hell does that even mean?

Oh and if you were wondering, no, Punching Kitty will not be involved in the parade this year, but if you see anything crazy down there or here anything we might want to know, you know where to toss us a note right? tips[at]punchingkitty[dot]com

_[Editor&#8217;s Note: Also, if you really want us to see your boobs, feel free to send us a pic or two at the tips email address as well.  We promise we won&#8217;t fine you. ]_
