Lets face it.  Hoosiers love football.  Its not like Nascar where only hoosiers like it, but still&#8230;hoosiers love football.

Ya think any of these totally liberal and culturally understanding fellas were a tad taken aback by the impeding sale of the Rams to some guy that didn&#8217;t look like them?

Here&#8217;s a fun game! Go to the first post that broke the story on STLToday.com (<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/rams/story/130588200E53CBEC862576C700219A8C?OpenDocument#tp_newCommentAnchor" target="_blank">here</a>) and count the number of times some STLToday moderator had to remove someone&#8217;s comment for being &#8220;off topic.&#8221; That&#8217;s how many douche bag racist ass holes are in our midst!  Fun huh?
