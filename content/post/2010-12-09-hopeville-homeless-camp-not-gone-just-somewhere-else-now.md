While Hopeville I is gone, as planned, Hopeville II was created so that there could be another really really sad place named something that sounds really really happy. Irony is awesome and St. Louis is full of it. _Well_ston is anything but &#8220;well&#8221;, _Kings_highway, looks like a dog scrapped his poopy butt through St. Louis rather than a road for kings and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd is nothing but people getting shot all the time&#8230;wait, that one makes sense.

So it sounds like the city is cool with this one for now and it seems like the people like living there, so good for them. Also, we just want to take this moment to say that we never have any change. Ever. Homeless people should really think about investing in a <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square device</a>.

Speaking of Hopeville, here&#8217;s a short video we found of an interview with a Hopeville I resident:
