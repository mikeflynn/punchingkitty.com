> &#8220;If this is the world we helped create,&#8221; guitarist James Suptic said, after looking into the crowd at a reunion gig, &#8220;then I apologise.&#8221;

Oh its ok guys.  Emo isn&#8217;t all bad!  There are some good things&#8230;

> &#8220;There should be a How to Be a Pop-Punk Kid Starter Kit with bands like the Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on,&#8221; Fall Out Boy&#8217;s Pete Wentz told Alternative Press in 2005. &#8220;**Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for the Get Up Kids.**&#8220;

Never mind.  I hate you.
