Its snowing, its cold and whether or not you have gas or electric heat we are all using lots of energy these days so AmerenUE says &#8220;Yup, time to get the rate hike approved!&#8221; and it was all tied up and then that last Missouri regulator said &#8220;Um yeah sure&#8230;we aren&#8217;t going to come in today it&#8217;s snowy!  Approved!&#8221;

> The average AmerenUE residential customer will pay about $5.88 more a month for electricity, under a rate increase Missouri regulators approved Tuesday.
> 
> The commission voted 3-2 to allow AmerenUE, the Missouri utility operations of Ameren Corp., to increase its electric rates by 8 percent in order to raise $162.6 million in additional revenue, nearly $89 million less than what the utility had originally requested.

The good news? Once they stick it to us, they won&#8217;t be able to do it again for a while right?  

> Regulators also approved a clause that will allow Ameren to raise rates when its fuel costs rise. The clause grants a 95 percent pass through of fuel expenses, the commission said.

Son of a&#8230;

You think the guys that run AmerenUE, Laclede and Charter sit around in baby pools of $20&#8217;s and do blow off albino hooker&#8217;s asses on the weekend after taking a bunch of melatonin and eating a whole fucking bucket of chicken?

Yeah, me too.
