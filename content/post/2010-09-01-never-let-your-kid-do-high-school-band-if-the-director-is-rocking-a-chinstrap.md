> According to the Madison County State Attorney&#8217;s officer, 36-year-old Matthew Lang has to serve 85% of his sentence. He must also register as a sex offender.
> 
> Police say Lang had sex with the student more than once during school hours. Some of the encounters occurred at the school and others happened at locations away from the school.

Even more creepy, the guy has a mustache and a chinstrap beard. Gross. How do you drop of your 16 year old daughter in to this guy&#8217;s care for band practice when he looks like this?! Let me guess, you didn&#8217;t have to drop her off&#8230;Mr. Lang picked her up from your place in his window-less van with outside-locking doors and that big back of Snickers in the back.

Lang worked his way up from creepy janitor to band director by convincing the Alton school board he would be, with out a doubt, the best guy to teach high school girls how to blow in to something to make noise. Apparently Lang&#8217;s a moaner.

Ok, that last line even grossed us out.

&#8230;still gonna leave it in though.
