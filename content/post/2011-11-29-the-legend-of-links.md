Right now.

**Joe Sports Fan: **<a href="http://www.kfns.com/JoeSportsFan/Story.aspx?ID=1578636" target="_blank">A word (give or take a thousand) about JC Corcoran&#8230;</a>

JC Corcoran has dug himself a hole over this Pujols thing and <a href="https://twitter.com/punchingkitty/status/140999336703176704" target="_blank">has chosen to just keep digging</a>, and Joe Sports Fan is calling him on his shit. Good for them! A rare moment of clarity from a media website about how much they suck&#8230;written by someone that&#8217;s not actually on the radio&#8230;hmm. Never mind about the self awareness, but still a great piece.

**Off the Eaten Path:** <a href="http://offtheeatenpathstl.com/?p=1822" target="_blank">Fat & Nasty Night at Denny&#8217;s</a>

&#8230;weird. We thought every night at Denny&#8217;s was a fat and nasty night.

**Craigslist: **<a href="http://stlouis.craigslist.org/mis/2726125852.html" target="_blank">Beautiful Angel at Dennys &#8211; m4w &#8211; 29 (Warrenton)</a>

Our mistake! Apparently angels work at Denny&#8217;s, so it must just be a disgusting place full of ugly people only we when drive by and look in the window.
