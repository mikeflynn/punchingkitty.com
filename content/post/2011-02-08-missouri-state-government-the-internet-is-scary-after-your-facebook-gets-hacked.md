OMG:

> Internet hackers are targeting Missouri state representatives and their staff, and no one knows exactly how or why.

JK, LOL.

Really STLToday? &#8220;internet hackers&#8221;? You have the first line of your story about Missouri State officials getting their Facebook passwords cracked is about &#8220;internet hackers&#8221; mysteriously &#8220;targeting&#8221; the state representatives? You even got the little laptop floating in the blue internet image there. Really nicely done. Did you ask our grandma for help on this story?

> Since the legislative session started Jan. 5, five people on the House side of the Capitol have reported their Facebook accounts being hacked: three Republican legislators, one Democratic legislator and one Republican staffer.
> 
> It is the most concentrated, widespread rash of hacking events the House has seen.

Five. It&#8217;s only been five. Right here, at the height of the fools-tension built up by author Rebecca Berg, who sounds like she uses an abacus and leaves her computer in the corner because of the demons, seems like a good time to remind you that we aren&#8217;t talking about official state computers or government accounts, we&#8217;re talking about Facebook. The &#8220;secrets&#8221;, if any, that have been stolen are less Missouri government building access codes, and more like the date of their nephew&#8217;s bar mitzvah.

> If a hacker alters a lawmaker&#8217;s carefully crafted public message, the political damage can be immediate and lasting.

> &#8220;I just don&#8217;t trust this stuff, and now I know why,&#8221; [Donna Lichtenegger, R-Jackson] said.

Not really. We already forgot about the one that happened a couple of weeks ago&#8230;plus no one cares what the rep from Jackson thinks about anything on her Facebook. Great to hear you&#8217;re scared of the internet now because of your own lack of knowledge about it though. &#8220;Ow! Fire burn hand after me stupidly touch it! Me no like fire no more.&#8221;

> Meanwhile, at least one positive experience has come of a compromised Facebook account. Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Richmond Heights, whose Facebook account was hacked just one day after the start of session, has used her experience to foster new relationships — in real life, instead of on the Internet.
> 
> After hearing news last week that Lichtenegger&#8217;s Facebook had been hacked, too, Newman reached across the aisle to commiserate with her House colleague. She joked that the two have formed their own bipartisan caucus to discuss hacking-related matters.

&#8230;you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me with this crap.

> Newman said the rash of computer security breaches does concern her.
> 
> &#8220;Now that it&#8217;s happened to a few of us in the House — why? It does make you start to wonder,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the next step should be, but I&#8217;m very disconcerted.&#8221;

You&#8217;re a moron. Don&#8217;t play with Facebook at work. We talked to the taxpayers and they said they&#8217;d rather you spend the time finding them a job. &#8230;oh shit. Stand still. We think we see an &#8220;internet hacker&#8221; behind you! Oh nevermind. It was just a guy talking to a 12 year old girl on a sex chatroom. Whew. That was close! He could have &#8220;hacked&#8221; your Facebook account and then where would you be when they changed your status from &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s complicated&#8221;?! OMG?! Can you imagine?

Do you know how to get there? If you look at that picture they posted it&#8217;s just past the floating laptop, down the glowing internet hallway, take a right and then a left at the Starbucks. It will be the glowing blue door on your left.)
