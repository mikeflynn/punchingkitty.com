1. We don&#8217;t know why exactly the Cardinals need commercials, but we&#8217;re glad they still make them.

2. Ok, so  you don&#8217;t put in the newly acquired Matt Holiday, but you do put in Fredbird. Twice. **Update**: We stand corrected. There is a Holiday spot, but its not funny and thus we don&#8217;t think it counts.

3. Chris Carpenter clearly hates doing these things and it shows.

4. Of all the players in the spots, only the following can act: Brendan Ryan, Skip Schumaker. That is all.

5. Was booking Pujols too expensive? **Update**: There is one of Pujols, but we don&#8217;t really think filming his BP one day counts. Pffft.

6. You have a spot with Colby Rasmus and Yadi Molina and you pick Yadi to be the one with a line? We love you Yadi, but thank god your job requirement is mostly putting down fingers for communication.

7. Even though we think the whole mustache humor thing is pretty much beating a dead horse, this is our favorite:
