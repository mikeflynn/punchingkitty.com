Outside air conditioning unit are being stolen all over the Godfrey, Illinois area and police think it might be related to that area&#8217;s favorite new hobby: Heroin.

> The thefts of outdoor units, nearly twenty of them, have taken place in every month since February.

&#8230;but no one noticed until it got hot?

> Madison County Sheriff’s Lt. Kris Tharp says the targets are homes and businesses.

Brillant! Why bother stealing all those outside air conditioning units on cars and skateboards when &#8220;homes and businesses&#8221; are right there for the taking?!

> Lt. Tharp says they are talking with persons of interest and have collected some physical evidence.

Ah, they&#8217;re trying &#8220;police work&#8221; this time. It&#8217;s an interesting gambit, but it might just be crazy enough to work.

> He says even if someone is charged in the Godfrey thefts he sees this as a trend across the metro.

You hear that folks? &#8220;Stealing for drug money&#8221; is the big new trend in the metro area! We never thought that we&#8217;d see the day when the area&#8217;s criminals stopped committing crimes simply for the love of the game, but we guess that&#8217;s a sign of the times. Damn shame.
