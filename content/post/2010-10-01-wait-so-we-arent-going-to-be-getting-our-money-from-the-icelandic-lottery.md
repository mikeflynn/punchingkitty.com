Hello luck day! I told you that wasn&#8217;t a midget! He was wearing way too much green to be a regular midget!

> The letters are addressed from MTA Sweepstakes Lottery in Reykjavik, Iceland&#8217;s capital city. The letters say the recipients have won a large amount of money in the Icelandic Lottery.
> 
> People who call the number are told there is a one-time handling fee, processing fee or international wire-transfer fee &#8212; usually about $1,000. Once they have paid the fee, they learn the checks they receive for their payouts are forgeries.

What? No. It looks all official though. I heard Jeff next door won too, and so did Marcus at work&#8230;which seemed odd&#8230;but we could get a boat!

> Lt. Dave Lingle says any request for money up front in order to receive a larger amount of money in return, should be treated with suspicion. It is more than likely the arrangement will end up being some type of a financial scam, he said.

Well well well Lt. Lingle, which sounds fake by the way, maybe you just want all the winnings to yourself! You heard about Iceland&#8217;s plan to give crap loads of money to people in St. Louis and thought you could get in on that action! Nice try Lingle!

&#8230;on the other hand, the only thing we know about Iceland that they beat Team USA really bad in the first round of the world hockey tournament and _then_ we saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109520/" target="_blank">Coach Bombay</a> out with that Iceland chick! Well, we may never get that money, or our $1,000 &#8220;processing fee&#8221; back, but at least still we have our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqq-glymrRs" target="_blank">Knuckle-puck shot</a> and enough sassy attitude to get Team USA back on track just in time for their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxJkAQFGEyo" target="_blank">rematch in the finals</a>!
