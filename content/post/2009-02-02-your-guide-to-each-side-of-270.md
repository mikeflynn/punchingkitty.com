I went out to the parent&#8217;s house out in the depths of St. Charles County today for the big game. Â It was the first time I&#8217;ve traveled west of 270 for the first time in months and after reminding myself of the differences I thought I would make a little field guide for those that stick to their side of town.

**East of 270 you will see:**

  * Obama bumper stickers
  * VW Beetles
  * Black people
  * Evidence of car theft
  * Buses
  * Martini bars

**West of 270 you will see:**

  * McCain bumper stickers
  * Wal-Marts
  * Minivans
  * Cut off jeans
  * Those &#8220;3&#8221; stickers that I think have something to do with Nascar
  * Lakes

Anything I&#8217;m missing on either side?
