Rams&#8217; Steven Jackson vs Cardinals&#8217; Albert Pujols**

The two faces of their franchises and two nice guys, beating the hell out each other.  Should be awesome.

_Winner? **Pujols**._ Steven Jackson is great, but Pujols never loses.

**2. KMOV&#8217;s Virginia Kerr vs KTVI&#8217;s April Simpson**

<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/11/11/virginia-kerrs-hot-reporter-competition-fox2s-april-simpson/" target="_blank">There&#8217;s history here</a>, which will make this a sellout for sure.  Some would see this and think this is some testosterone-fueled idea to see to chicks brawl and they&#8217;d be right, if they thought I wanted this to be in bikinis, which I don&#8217;t!  I want this fight in the fancy &#8220;you should trust me because I&#8217;m non-threatening&#8221; outfits. Yup, this will be one classy fight.

Also note that this one would have to be in jell-o.

_Winner?_ **_Virginia Kerr_** _in an upset!_ She just seems scrappy.

**3. St. Louis Rams vs Mizzou Tigers**

Sure the sane sports fan in us says &#8220;The Rams may be 1-15, but they are still professionals and will wax the floor with a college team.&#8221; &#8230;the other side of me says &#8220;Prove it.&#8221;

_Winner? **Rams**._ It&#8217;ll be closer than it should be though.

**4. Charles Jaco vs Adam Sharp**

&#8230;wait. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/02/23/charles-jaco-might-be-getting-sued-but-he-definitely-cant-find-a-good-comeback/" target="_blank">This one already happened</a> and it was really really really gay.  Not like &#8220;I can&#8217;t get married because rednecks are scared of me&#8221;, but just like&#8230;you know&#8230;gay.

_Winner? **No one**_&#8230;or both.  Ties are confusing, They are both lame.  Did that clear it up?

**5. Axel Rose vs St. Louis**

First there was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHb-8cOtzCs#t=1m9s" target="_blank">this</a>&#8230;and now its the rematch of the century!  No, no no: F*ck _you_ Axel!

_Winner? **St. Louis**._ Axel promises he will come back with a huge awesome new group of people to kick our asses. But we&#8217;re betting he won&#8217;t or even he does it will be like totally weak, and no one will care.
