Where can the St. Louis Rams all-time leading rusher go to talk about the lack or Rams receivers, a possible NFL lockout and how great his hair is, all while looking like he&#8217;s getting his senior photo taken? Versus T. Ocho show!

The awkward show, hosted by&#8230;um&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t matter, with controversial Cincinnati wide receivers Terrell Owens and Chad Ocho Cinco on a big screen, has a weekly guest that the two receivers mumble questions at while the host tries to save the show and try not to catch a look at himself in something reflective and have an instant suicidal reaction to where he career has lead him.

On how T.O. was nearly a Ram this past offseason:

> **Owens**: &#8220;I was like&#8230;litterally 24 hours away from being in St. Louis and this T. Ocho wouldn&#8217;t be possible right now.
> 
> **Jackson**: No it wouldn&#8217;t man. You know. We would have been a good tag-team, bro, you know. You wouldn&#8217;t have to fight for catches around here, I&#8217;ll tell you that.
> 
> [Awkward laughing]

On the differences in the show if Jackson was one of the hosts:

> **Jackson**: It seems that you are lacking some style, some hair. I would bring a whole different angle from it.

On the possibility of an NFL lockout next year:

> **Jackson**: Well the lockout is definitely possible. It&#8217;s something we need to be conscious about and we tell the young kids to save their money and be prepared for a lockout.

Interesting, but stupid&#8230;just like Terrell Owens himself. The important thing is that none of that stupid transfered to our boy SJ39. You&#8217;re cool, right Steve?!

Well, crap.
