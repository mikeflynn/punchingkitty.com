A link has been making the rounds recently of a Craigslist ad from a man calling himself the Vindicator, and he claims he is St. Louis&#8217; masked vigilante. Nothing like putting a Craigslist ad out there in the &#8220;nonprofit jobs&#8221; section to drum up interest in your burgeoning superhero career. We believe this is the same way Batman found Robin&#8230;that was back in the day though when grown men could put an ad up that read &#8220;Powerful man in tight clothes and cape looking for young athletic boy to help beat off Gotham City&#8217;s biggest brutes! Must love masks.&#8221; and just think they&#8217;re looking for a sidekick.

> Im [sic] the Vindicator
> 
> (Although I hate to Say it) Im [sic] a masked Vigilante who patrols the St. Louis City area looking for, stopping, and eliminating the possibility of crime through non-lethal (yet possible physical) means.
> 
> I dont [sic] carry ballistic guns byt am well equiped [sic] to disarm a coward with one.

Specializing in &#8220;danger&#8221;, night stalkings, bullies, domestic violence and we believe, bar mitzvahs, he goes on to say that any attempts to interview him will &#8220;result in denial&#8221; which makes perfect sense since there&#8217;s little doubt he can offer you, or himself, anything else these days. Oh we also won&#8217;t try to interview him because no one cares. We played superhero for the first decade of our lives and you don&#8217;t see anyone giving a crap about that! No we didn&#8217;t have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002325873361" target="_blank">a Facebook page</a> (His employer is &#8220;justice&#8221;!) or <a href="mailto:dark.vindicator@yahoo.com" target="_blank">a Yahoo! mail account</a>, but it was a different time then. A time before YouTube when crazy tended to say a little more localized.

Sadly the post has been flagged for removal on Craigslist, but our intrepid tipster managed to grab a screenshot on his phone:

If you are walking the streets of St. Louis one night and see a caped avenger, snap a few photos for us. He&#8217;ll be the one in the hat and gloves because his mom would hate to see him catch a cold because of his new hobby.
