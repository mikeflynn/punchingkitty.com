Thursday night, Comedy Central&#8217;s The Daily Show revealed that correspondent Olivia Munn was in Missouri checking out the story on our infamous Puppy Mill law, aka Proposition B.



Dammit! Why didn&#8217;t anyone else think of asking Dog Whisperer, Ceasar Milan about the puppy mil. It would have been over and done from the start and we wouldn&#8217;t have to hear people argue about puppies all the time. We figured if you added puppies to anything it made it cuter, but that is apparently not the case with politics.
