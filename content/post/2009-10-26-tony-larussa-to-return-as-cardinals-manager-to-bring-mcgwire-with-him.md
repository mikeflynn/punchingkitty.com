[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2082" title="larussa_tony" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/larussa_tony.jpg" alt="larussa_tony" width="175" height="175" />][1]According to [the St. Louis Post Dispatch][2], long-time Cardinal skipper Tony LaRussa will return to the Cardinals for at least the 2010 season, which is pretty much what every one thought would happen.  The Cardinals return next year with at least the best hitter in the game in Pujols and the tandem of Cy Young candidate pitchers in Adam Wainwright and Chris Carpenter, together that is a recipe most managers, especially Tony, just can&#8217;t pass up.

What is a surprise is that Tony has brought along an old friend: Former home run champ and current baseball recluse Mark McGwire as the team&#8217;s new hitting coach.

Crrraaazzzy!

What will it be like in spring training with the media?  Will the players that haven&#8217;t played or worked with him before work with Big Mac?  I don&#8217;t know, so **take our poll at the bottom of this post** to let everyone know your thoughts.

What I do know, is that I&#8217;ve been sitting on this video for the minute Tony officially decided to return as manager:
