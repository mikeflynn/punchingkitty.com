What former high-flying star of St. Louis wants a local comeback as bad as he wanted out of a small local media ownership group?

We hear that he recently made the choice to do what he has never been known to do, _drop_ his long-time holdings in the company after their recent, and what many think is an ill-advised,Â acquisition.
