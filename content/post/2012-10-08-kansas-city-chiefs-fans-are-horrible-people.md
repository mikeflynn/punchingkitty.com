Unlike our now beloved 3 &#8211; 2 Rams, Kansas City is having a hard time with their football team, the Chiefs. They aren&#8217;t good, and the fans think it would be better if the team ditched their current starting quarterback, Matt Cassel, in favor of the backup, Brady Quinn, so when the Chiefs game started Sunday and everyone saw Cassel out there against the heavy favorited Ravens, they weren&#8217;t pleased. Outside of a win (not gonna happen) we wonder what could cheer a stadium full of hate-filled Chiefs fans up?

> Much-maligned Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel got knocked out of his teamâ€™s 9-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. Because he is an awful quarterback and has underperformed ever since arriving in Kansas City, some of the dumber fans in attendance allegedly cheered when he left the field.

They cheered when their own quarterback got hurt and had to leave the game. That is amazingly cold, and Chiefs offensive lineman Eric Winston was a little fired up on the matter after the game:

> But when you cheer, when you cheer somebody getting knocked out, I don&#8217;t care who it is, and it just so happened to be Matt Cassel &#8212; it&#8217;s sickening. It&#8217;s 100 percent sickening. I&#8217;ve been in some rough times on some rough teams, I&#8217;ve never been more embarrassed in my life to play football than in that moment right there.
> 
> Boo him all you want. Boo me all you want. Throw me under the bus. Tell me I&#8217;m doing a bad job. Say I gotta protect him more. Do whatever you want. Say whatever you want. But if you are one of those people, one of those people that were out there cheering or even smiled when he got knocked out, I just want to let you know, and I want everybody to know that I think it&#8217;s sickening and disgusting. We are not gladiators and this is not the Roman Coliseum. This is a game.

So there you have it, Kansas City fans are jerks. They hate their own players so much it makes them happy when they get hurt. You&#8217;d think Kansas City would be used to horrible sports teams by now, but it would appear that&#8217;s not the case, and their continued rage makes them horrible people. Also, every city has BBQ places, ok? Every one. So lets stop pretending you&#8217;re the only one. The fact is, St. Louis has Pappy&#8217;s Smokehouse and we treat our sports figures with respect&#8230;unless Mike Matheny keeps deciding to bunt even though he just replaced David Freese with Chambers for speed! What the hell is that?! Either put a fast guy out there or bunt, but don&#8217;t do both! What is wrong with you?! Oh, and lets not forget Matheny pulling Boggs for Scrabble when we all knew Scrabble was going to screw the whole thing up WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE?! Get ass cancer! Get it right now!

&#8230;.\*ahem\*

We meant to say &#8220;We&#8217;ll get em next time Cardinals!&#8221;
