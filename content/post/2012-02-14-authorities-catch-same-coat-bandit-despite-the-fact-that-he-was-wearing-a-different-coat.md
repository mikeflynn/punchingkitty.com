Authorities have somehow managed to capture last week&#8217;s famed &#8220;Same Coat Bandit&#8221;, so named because he wore the same coat a couple of times and apparently the Feds are big sticklers to the fashion trends of this season&#8217;s thieves and decided to publicly berate the guy.[<img class="alignright  wp-image-12953" title="nicholas_hummel" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/02/nicholas_hummel.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]

> Nicholas J. Hummel, 29, of the 5700 block of Loran Avenue, was charged with two counts of second-degree robbery.
> 
> Authorities also suspect Hummel in three other bank recent bank robberies in the St. Louis area. The FBI labeled him the &#8220;Same Coat Bandit&#8221; because he apparently has worn the same tan jacket in each robbery.

Authorities remain mum on how they caught Hummel and it&#8217;s especially puzzling since in his mughshot (right) he&#8217;s wearing a different coat. What do mean he had another coat?! This is the &#8220;Same Coat Bandit&#8221; for crying out loud! How sure are we this is the guy?! Clearly this will be the defense&#8217;s entire case. Where is the coat? He&#8217;s not wearing the coat now, is he? Hell he&#8217;s not even wearing a coat at all! He actually is more of a &#8220;light jacket&#8221; or &#8220;heavy sweatshirt used as a jacket&#8221; kinda guy, so clearly this &#8220;Same Coat Bandit&#8221; is still on the loose. This man is clearly innocent and we rest our case.

Maybe that&#8217;s a tad far fetched, but you gotta wonder how they clearly had enough information to catch the guy relatively quickly, yet not enough data to give this guy a better name.

> Police said Hummel was charged with two counts of robbery because two bank tellers were targeted.

It really doesn&#8217;t matter now, but Hummel&#8217;s looking for a new nickname, the &#8220;Really? Well Crap. Totally Didn&#8217;t Know Robbery Charges Worked That Way Bandit&#8221; seems like it might be appropriate.
