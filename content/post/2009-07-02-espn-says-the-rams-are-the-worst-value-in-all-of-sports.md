In the most recent issue of ESPN The Magazine (July 13, 2009) they released their annual Ultimate Standings where they grade all NBA, NFL and MLB teams in things like &#8220;Stadium Experience,&#8221; &#8220;Fan Relations,&#8221; and &#8220;Ownership.&#8221;

In the &#8220;Bang for the Buck&#8221; category, which is &#8220;wins over the past year per revenues directly from fans, adjusted for league schedules&#8221;, the Rams came in dead last, as in 122 out of 122. Â Well done guys.

Other notable St. Louis team appearances are the Blues coming in #3 the &#8220;Swag&#8221; category (for their &#8220;free food&#8221; nights) and the Cardinals tied for #1 in the &#8220;Title Track&#8221; category along with the Los Angeles Angels and the D-Town Red Wings, which measures &#8220;Championships already won or expected within the lifetime of current fans&#8221;

The overall rankings have the Blues at #10, Cardinals at #26 and the Rams at #112.
