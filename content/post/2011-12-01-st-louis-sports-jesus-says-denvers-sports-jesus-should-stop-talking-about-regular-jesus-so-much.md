That headline is legit! We swear to G&#8230;eh. Better not do that in this post. Seriously though, Kurt Warner took some time the other day to tell Tim Tebow, he who&#8217;s name in verb form means a quick post-game prayer in the middle of the freaking field or any other random place (<a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">Tebowing.com</a>), to give it a rest with the God talk.

> “You can’t help but cheer for a guy like that,” Warner said of Tebow. “But I’d tell him, ‘Put down the boldness in regards to the words, and keep living the way you’re living. Let your teammates do the talking for you. Let them cheer on your testimony.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I don’t want anybody to become calloused toward Tim because they don’t understand him, or are not fully aware of who he is. And you’re starting to see that a little bit.”

No one tells Tim Tebow to stop talkin&#8217; god! Unless&#8230;Oh snap. Kurt Warner is clearly the quarterback on Team Satan now, meaning he&#8217;ll soon be saying dirty words like &#8220;evolution&#8221; and <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/12/kurt_warner_dancing.jpeg" target="_blank">dancing like one of those homosexuals</a>!

That was a joke at first, but now it makes a lot of sense. How else could you explain the sudden upgrade in attractiveness with Brenda a few years back?
