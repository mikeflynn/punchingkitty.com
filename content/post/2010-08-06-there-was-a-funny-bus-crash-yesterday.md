Though at one point we heard a clown was involved, but that proved to be false, meaning we needed a funny crash to lighten up the driving mood. Thank god that Metro Bus driver had a diabetic reaction and drove her bus in to a tree!

We feel bad about eating that bag of crackers and hard candy we found in the front of that bus today now.

Also of note is comment a KMOV user banged out that sounds like something, but as far as we can tell, means absolutely nothing.

It&#8217;s beautiful really. Freaking retarded though&#8230;which is probably why it makes us think of this:
