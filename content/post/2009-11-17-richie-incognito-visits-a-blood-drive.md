After this happy moment you see here, Richie told everyone there that just because they were giving blood they knew how to cheer for the Rams.  Then he punched this lovely lady in the face and took off early.  When asked for a comment, Coach Spagnolo said &#8220;he was just really &#8216;fired up&#8217; for the blood drive and  you have to do appearances with passion.&#8221;

Its also worth noting that half way through the appearance, a member of the Seahawks came in, signed autographs and managed to walk past Incognito and knocked down Marc Bulger making sure that the Rams lost this too.
