We received a hot&#8230;well maybe we should call it &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8230;tip from one of our readers that witnessed a grown man crapping his pants at a bar, as in, in public, as in, running down his leg while he tried to casually walk over to the john. Too bad the men&#8217;s room doesn&#8217;t usually have those pull down changing tables.

> I was at Double D&#8217;s Lounge on Brentwood saturday. A dude in his twenties proceeded to poop his pants, leaving a trail of doody into the men&#8217;s restroom. I heard he was nice enough to leave his poopy drawers in the bathroom. I saw him standing outside with poop on his leg.

I know no one likes to pop a squat in a public place, but maybe this may not have been a &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold it until we get home&#8221; type situation looking back on it. If only we had a photo of the _poop_etrator so that people could say &#8220;I know that dude!&#8221;. Wait, what&#8217;s this? Mr. Blockquote has something to say!

  You know its weird, but looking at this photo, I only see one poopy and one non-poopy calf with feet. I don&#8217;t see anything from the where the knees would be up&#8230;oh! Camo pants. Damn shame those are ruined because those things work great. Totally blend right in. One time I thought I saw a guy with the top of his head chopped off, freaked me out man. Long story short&#8230;<a href="http://www.ehatmania.com/images/headwraps/camo/Z190SC.jpg" target="_blank">snow camo bandana thing</a>.  Also, when someone tells  you they aren&#8217;t a zombie you should stop hitting them with your shovel.
