There&#8217;s a &#8220;serial groper&#8221; on the loose in Clayton, usually operating across the street from the St. Louis County Jail. It&#8217;s a perfect plan. Who&#8217;s going to believe some broad who&#8217;s going to jail?

> Officers say it’s happened at least three times in recent weeks, mostly on weekend evenings.
> 
> The man commits the act in a public parking lot, then runs away before his victim has time to react.

We didn&#8217;t think it was all that odd for a criminal to not hang around and get caught or identified, but apparently it&#8217;s worth mentioning.

So what&#8217;s the move? How do we catch this guy? What&#8217;s he look like?

> He’s described as white or Hispanic, in his early 20′s, under five-foot-ten inches tall, with a thin to medium build and black shoulder-length hair.

&#8230;and here&#8217;s a sketch (top right).

That&#8217;s a pretty clear description and sketch, so it shouldn&#8217;t be that hard to find him&#8230;wait a minute! Are we looking for 70s David Cassidy?!

  Look at that smug son of a bitch. He knows he&#8217;s going to get away with it because of his time machine&#8230;wait wait wait wait. This doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Has anyone seen Danny Bonaduce? This feels like a frame up.

  Any of these Partridge Family references doing anything for you? We&#8217;re not even old enough for these references, but here we are. No idea why a little guy groping ladies in a parking garage in Clayton got us to the Partridge Family, but it did and we&#8217;re way to lazy to delete this post and start over again now.
