Harry Pujols&#8230;or phonetically&#8230;Harry Poo-holes.

Seriously.

Here&#8217;s a photo:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4496" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/13/albert-pujols-has-a-cousin-named-harry/harry_pujols/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4496" title="harry_pujols" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/harry_pujols.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="408" height="500" /></a>Confirmed from a good source that is this in fact our very own Albert&#8217;s cousin.

Now that we&#8217;ve settled that its true, there&#8217;s the matter of why the hell anyone with the last name of Pujols would go by Harry. Hank&#8230;Harrison&#8230;Skippy&#8230;Lorenzo&#8230;Albertsmycousingivemethings?! All of those would go much better in front of Pujols than Harry.

We know what you are thinking: Use your middle name! Sadly we&#8217;ve found out that Harry&#8217;s middle name is Fingermy. So maybe stick with Harry after all.
