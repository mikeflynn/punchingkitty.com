> Reds third baseman Scott Rolen will likely miss at least three more games due to the presence of post-concussion symptoms.
> 
> Following the team&#8217;s 5-2 win Sunday against the San Francisco Giants, head athletic trainer Mark Mann told reporters Rolen wouldn&#8217;t engage in any strenuous physical activity until his symptoms (including an inability to focus) subside.

Over a week ago, Rolen was plunked in the head with a pitch.  At the time it was thought he would be back in action for St. Louis giving rise to thousands of &#8220;Rolen vs LaRussa: Round 2&#8221; columns and tweets.  It was not to be though as clearly Rolen&#8217;s symptoms still haven&#8217;t subsided.

One theory is that Don Tony called in a hit on Rolen so he didn&#8217;t have to deal with a series that is all about his failed relationship with his former third baseman&#8230;however that theory is blow apart by simply looking at who hit him.

> Rolen was hit in the head **by a Jason Marquis pitch** Sunday. He returned to action by homering Wednesday and going 1-for-5 and scoring twice in Friday&#8217;s win over the Giants. Manager Dusty Baker said Rolen didn&#8217;t feel entirely right after the game.

So Rolen was laced in the melon by one of the only people that Tony has pissed off more than himself.  &#8220;All My Cardinals&#8221; is really a soap opera the world should be watching&#8230;its crazy!

Here are some future storylines we want to see:

1. Rolen get amnesia and forgets what team he plays for and the fact that he hates Tony, showing up in the Card&#8217;s locker room ready to play third.  The Cardinals decide to let him, and give DeRosa a night off since they can&#8217;t stand Thurston over there any more.

2. Tony has a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">evil</span> nice twin!

3. A guy with a goat shows up and puts a hex on the Cardinals.  Er&#8230;wait&#8230;what are the odds of that happening twice in the same division?

4. Todd Wellemeyer gets possessed by the devil.  He pukes green stuff between every inning, but it adds 5 miles on his fastball and his breaking stuff is sharper so Dave Duncan tries to let the rest of the staff &#8220;catch it&#8221; by making them all have a sleep over.

5. Joe Thurston falls down an elevator shaft and lands in a coma.  Both his defense and batting average stay unchanged so no one notices.
