That&#8217;s fine and all, but the Rams had a buyer already. Their&#8217;s way better stuff for Kroenke to drop his cash on&#8230;

10. Arby&#8217;s. _Who doesn&#8217;t love Arby&#8217;s?_

9. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/home" target="_blank">A soccer team</a>.

8. 4,000 pairs of white socks. _Never buy socks again._

7. Nickelback. _So they&#8217;ll never play again._

6. 1 lion, 1 gorilla, 1 cage, tons of seats.

5. The cast and set of [Charles In Charge][2].

4. A massaging robot&#8230;an _asian_ massaging robot. For us. As a present.

3. Kryptonite, to finally stop that insufferable Superman!

2. Me. _\*wink\*_

1. Better hair.
