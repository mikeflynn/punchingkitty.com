Yes, _that_ Corle 2 Da. The very one we (in)famously <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/the-worst-music-video-ever-was-shot-in-a-st-louis-condos-kitchen/" target="_blank">took a few shots at</a>, and who later dropped us a line to let us know that he can take a joke, which is awesome! So in honor of that particularly scarce skill that we can only hope others learn from _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Looking at you Loesch, Jaco, Marlow, religious people and fatties!]_, we shot a few questions his way to get a little better understanding of the man behind the YouTube videos.

&#8212;

**Punching Kitty:** Lets get right to it! We famously reviewed your &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; video, but to be fair, it&#8217;s done quite well on YouTube with well over 20k views. Has the response been as good as YouTube makes it seem?

> Actually the response from &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; has been very good, it is doing well on youtube, as well as it was just nominated for video of the year by RFT.  Haha you guys got a few good ones in on me on that review&#8230;but it&#8217;s all good, gotta take the good with the bad&#8230;.no thin skins&#8230;.

**PK:** You had at least 823 different locations in that video, how long did it take to film?

> The video for &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; took about 4-5 total days to shoot&#8230;we were really on the move all over the city&#8230;but it was all a learning experience, and I would say overall it turned out good, for having little to no budget.

**PK:** <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K311zQEdZA" target="_blank">The new video is &#8220;Digital&#8221;</a> which leads off with a chase scene of sorts. Where did you film that?

> The chase scene in the &#8220;Digital&#8221; video was shot in a server building in St. Louis.

**PK:** How much was &#8220;Digital&#8221; influenced by Weird Al Yankovic&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos" target="_blank">It&#8217;s All About the Pentiums</a>&#8220;? Weird Al is like the Beatles to all rappers right?

> That Weird Al Yankovic song is actually pretty funny, I had no idea that video existed until I watched your link&#8230;so unfortunately the &#8220;Digital&#8221; song was not influenced by Weird Al, but i can definitely see why someone would think that or even ask that question.  Lol another good comparison!

**PK:** Give us a little background: How long have you been at preforming? Where are you from?

> Background on Corle 2 Da&#8230;I was born in Alton, reside in Belleville, and have been performing locally around St. Louis, The Eastside (Illinois),  Chicago, and Memphis since 2003.

**PK:** Can you explain the story behind your name?

> The story behind the name&#8230;.ok, to make a long story short, I used to go by the artist/stage name of Corleone Da Hustla, after a few years with that I wanted to switch it up, as well as shorten it up, so I shortened Corleone to Corle, dropped off the &#8220;Hustla&#8221;, and the 2 comes from well like pt. 2, rebirth, sequel, whatever&#8230;so basically in a nutshell that is how i came up with the name Corle 2 Da, pronounced (Cor- Lee Two- duh) for those who didn&#8217;t know&#8230;.

**PK:** Clearly you&#8217;re a cardinals fan. What you do think about the Pujols situation? Is he going to stick around?

> Pujols situation is crazy! I believe it would be best for him, his career, the Cardinal Organization, and Cardinal Nation if we get him signed before SPRING TRAINING!!!! It will be a sad day in St. Louis if Albert Pujols signs a multiyear contract with another team and doesn&#8217;t retire a Cardinal&#8230;&#8230;

**PK:** You&#8217;ve given visual shoutouts to the RFT in both &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; and &#8220;Digital&#8221; is this interview our first step in getting a Punching Kitty appearance?

> Ah a Punching Kitty appearance&#8230;in an upcoming video I&#8217;m guessing, well it is definitely a possibility, the RFT has been real supportive of my work and I appreciate that.  I saw you won an award at RFT web awards as well didn&#8217;t you?  Really though, they are great at recognizing people and topics in the community.

**PK:** How many blueberry muffins do you think you could eat in an hour?

> I could probably eat about 25-30 blueberry muffins in an hour, that would also depend on the size of the muffins and if Milk was included!

**PK:** Good answer!

**PK:** So what&#8217;s next? Where do you go from &#8220;Digital&#8221;?

> After &#8220;Digital&#8221; we will be shooting the next single which is called &#8220;Movement&#8221;  it will be a darker video&#8230;a bit more grimy, but it should be a great video, then after that look for something for the LADIES!

**PK:** &#8230;so it&#8217;s a grimy video called &#8220;Movement&#8221;? Um&#8230;we may have already seen that. Came out a few years ago&#8230;we think it was called &#8220;Corle 2 Girls 1 Cup&#8221;

**PK:** Seriously though, thanks again for the time man and good luck in the future! Anything else you want to add?

> I would like to shout out to all the guys at Media Outlaws, Hollow Wear, and Red River Ent. that help me make it happen! Shout out to Punching Kitty!

&#8212;

Did you just feel that?! It was us, getting mad cred.
