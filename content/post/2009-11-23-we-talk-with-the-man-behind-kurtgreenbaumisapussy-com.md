We recently traded emails with the anonymous operator of the site.  Here is the interview:

**Punching Kitty:** First off, thanks for the links.  We are truly honored!

> Thanks for giving attention to what I think is a very interesting and important public discussion about what happened here.

**PK:** Are you from the St. Louis area?

_No answer._

**PK:** Am I to assume you are trying to stay anonymous, or do you want to tell us who you are?

_No answer._

**PK:** Where did you find out about the Greenbaum story originally?

> I think I saw it making some traction on Reddit and Digg.  It seemed to have legs so I started following it.  Then I realized how disturbing it was.

**PK:** Clearly you are fired up about the story.  What about all of this really pissed you off enough to make this site?

> I think there are a few reasons for the depth of the response:
> 
> 1.  His actions seem to be a grave betrayal and inconsistent with Internet culture.  They also seem to be inconsistent with newspaper culture; he, in effect, ratted out one of his anonymous sources, so whether you prefer old media or new media, this is very bad.
> 
> 2.  His actions seem to be hypocritical.  He&#8217;s gone to some length to establish himself as an expert and journeyman in the field of &#8220;social media&#8221;, encouraging us to think of him as a bridge between the old media St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the new media Internet.  And then as soon as he sees something mildly vulgar, he uses old-school, thuggish, command-and-control tactics to impose his morality on someone else and costs them their job.  He wants us to trust him as being Internet-savvy, but then he completely blows it.  Because verifying identity on the Internet is so hard, the Internet is especially is especially twitchy and vindictive about rooting out impostors.
> 
> 3.  One of the reasons I made the site was that Wikipedia is refusing to permit a page about him.  There needs to be a central repository for information about this story.  I saw a need&#8230;
> 
> 4.  I created the site as a public service and as a small contribution to my responsibilities as an engaged citizen.  At first, I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s It!  I&#8217;m buying a major American newspaper company and giving people a piece of my mind on the editorial page!&#8221;.  But then I realized I only had 30 minutes or so to work on this, so I made a website instead.  Old media is dead.

**PK:** How&#8217;s the site doing?  Getting a lot of page views?

> So far 30,000+ page views.  See the current total at the top of the home page at <a style="color: #2a5db0;" href="http://www.KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com/" target="_blank">www.KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com</a>.  I&#8217;m expecting traffic to expand greatly tomorrow (Monday) morning.

**PK:** You also registered _KurtGreenbaum.com_ as well and redirected it to _KurtGreenBaumIsAPussy.com_. How exicited were you when you realized he hadn&#8217;t registered it yet himself?!

> I just simply couldn&#8217;t believe he hadn&#8217;t already registered them.  I went back to several news sources and repeatedly checked the spelling.  I see this as further proof that he&#8217;s actually rather clueless about the Internet.  And &#8220;KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy&#8221; was too good of a double entendre to pass up.

**PK:** Has Greenbaum or anyone connected to him tried to get ahold of you yet?

> No, but I&#8217;d be willing to talk with him.  I&#8217;ll bet we could have a very interesting, mutually beneficial conversation.

**PK:** Well thanks for taking the time to answer a few questions.  The site is hilarious.  Anything else you want to add?

> I think there are a few open questions that need to be asked far and wide:
> 
> 1.  What has been the response of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch?  They seem to be hunkering down and hoping this all blows over.
> 
> 2.  What has been Kurt Greenbaum&#8217;s response?  He too seems to be hunkering down, restricting access to his social media accounts, blocking comments, etc.
> 
> 3.  Given that the school Mr. Greenbaum called has a &#8220;headmaster&#8221;, that says private school, no public school.  Is it possible one of his children is a student at that school, and thus Greenbaum felt expanded license to contact them?
> 
> 4.  Why haven&#8217;t we heard from the school itself, or the affected employee?  I&#8217;m surprised these facts haven&#8217;t yet come out.
> 
> 5.  I suspect Greenbaum is using this as material for a book.  It might be an interesting read.  I hope it&#8217;s not simply a moan about how the Internet is destroying good old-fashioned Midwestern values.

Once again thanks to (Not) Kurt Greenbaum to taking the time to answer our questions.

We&#8217;re glad he threw in those point at the end of the interview, because he really has some interesting questions, #3 in particular.

> Is it possible one of his children is a student at that school, and thus Greenbaum felt expanded license to contact them?

This is a great point, and if true, would actually loosen the noose (albeit, very slightly) around Greenbaum&#8217;s neck.

Once again, we would love to get a hold of the affected employee and even Mr. Greenbaum to get their sides of the story as well.  For any information you would like to share, 100% anonymously, hit us up at tips@punchingkitty.com or 314-266-TIPS (voice or text)
