Everyone knows by now that have the world&#8217;s supply of popular 80s icons named Corey has been dropped by half after the news yesterday of Corey Haim&#8217;s death that made the world stand up and say &#8220;Oh yeah! &#8230;Wait, which one was he?&#8221;

But did you know that there was a late-life connection between Haim and St. Louis?  &#8230;and it was right under TMZ&#8217;s nose!

Seen on the right and below, looking like he took an overdose of cool rather than horse tranquilizer or whatever is Corey Haim rocking the t-shirt of the band Unset. which is on the St. Louis-based label <a href="http://www.gridironrecords.com/" target="_blank">Gridiron Records</a>!

If that name sounds familiar, its because it should. Former Ram Kyle Turley is cranking out music these days and is also a Gridiron Records artist.

Having your band&#8217;s t-shirt on <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/10/corey-haim-dead-died-death-lapd-overdose-corey-feldman-lost-boys-two-coreys/" target="_blank">the front page of TMZ</a> attached to the biggest celeb story of the day is some nice promotion and very convenient that Turley&#8217;s record was just released Tuesday&#8230;

Do we think Gridiron Records saw these pictures were taken and because of that had Haim killed and then quietly leaked these photos and the news to TMZ?

No, we don&#8217;t.

But that would be pretty god damned metal of them if they did.
