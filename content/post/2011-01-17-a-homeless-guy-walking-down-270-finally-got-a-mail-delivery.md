No? Oh, well&#8230;it&#8217;s on 270 by Dorsett Road. We&#8217;re sure it will be fine though, we hear mortgage companies are usually pretty chill on stuff like that.

> U.S. Postal Inspector Dan Taylor says the back door of a tractor trailer popped open on Interstate 270 near Dorsett Road in Maryland Heights around 4:30 a.m. Sunday. The truck continued onto Interstate 55 to Ste. Genevieve spilling hundreds of peices of mail along the way.

The mail came from a distribution center in Maryland Heights heading for Memphis, Tennessee. Nevermind, you probably will get your mortgage bill, but any out-going mail may be in jeopardy. Face it though, if you&#8217;re still using _real_ mail, then your old and it won&#8217;t really matter because you&#8217;ve already forgotten you sent it.

Either way, authorities believe that most, if not all, of the mail has been recovered.

A $40 Million dollar government task force has been formed to research the result, if any, of double-checking to see if a mail truck&#8217;s back door is latched before driving away will help alleviate this type of mail loss in the future.
