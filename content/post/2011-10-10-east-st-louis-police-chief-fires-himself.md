Count us as extremely surprised when we heard the news that East St. Louis&#8217; Police Chief, **Ranadore Foggs**, called it quits Saturday. Who the hell would have guessed that East St. Louis had a Police Chief?!

Chief Foggs told **Mayor Alvin Parks Jr.** about his decision Saturday.

> Foggs said he had philosophical differences with the mayor on how the police department should be run. Foggs said his character and integrity were important to him and making the city safe was his No. 1 goal, and that&#8217;s why he came aboard the police department.
> 
> &#8220;I am sorry to see him leave. Chief Foggs had every intention of making the town very safe and I do too,&#8221; Parks said. &#8220;If Chief Foggs feels as if it&#8217;s time for him to go &#8212; while we&#8217;re disappointed, if it&#8217;s his decision, I respectfully accept his resignation.&#8221;

One could hardly blame anyone in the unenviable position of trying to keep East St. Louis safe for quitting all of five months after accepting the job, but as much as we&#8217;d like to imagine Foggs looking at every crime scene and whispering &#8220;I&#8217;m getting too old for this shit.&#8221; over and over again, it seems like Foggs quit because Mayor Parks was a little too bossy.

> Councilman Delbert Marion, who spoke in an angry and serious tone about Foggs&#8217; resignation, said the mayor has been trying to run the department.
> 
> &#8220;The mayor&#8217;s political influence, or attempted political influence, in the police department is unwarranted,&#8221; he said.
> 
> He said the mayor was trying to tell the chief how to schedule his manpower for patrolling the streets. Marion said some of what Parks was trying to do violates the police officers&#8217; contract.

While city administrators bicker, East St. Louis is now left without any top-level police leadership and has plunged in to a deep darkness with the drugs, violence and fear running rampant on their now vacant city streets. Clearly something needs to be done&#8230;oh&#8230;right. It&#8217;s always like that. Scratch that. &#8230; The good news is, that despite concerns to the contrary, there has been no appreciable change in over-all crime levels despite being without a Police Chief!

Not sure what the process for East St. Louis Police Chiefs that want to quit is, but maybe it&#8217;s like that Judge Dredd movie with Stallone (trailer embedded below) where they just give you a shotgun and a trenchcoat, followed by a ceremony where they just push you out in to the vast wasteland and tell you to clean things up the best you can. That would seem a bit weird, since we&#8217;re pretty sure that&#8217;s what they do when they hire a new beat cop to go with the other three. On the other hand, pretty much everything about Judge Dredd (with the notable exception of hover-bikes) pretty much lines up perfectly with what East St. Louis has become in our mind.
