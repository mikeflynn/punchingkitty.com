Drive up to a church, nearly hitting the building, hop out and run screaming in to the building knocking old people out of the way until the police arrive. Apart from forgetting to lick Jesus&#8217; nipples on the crucifix statue, this plan went off without a hitch!

> Officer Melissa Doss, a spokeswoman for St. Peters police, said the man arrested also pushed another person while inside the church, laid hands on a third person and verbally assaulted another.
> 
> The man was held down until police arrived, Doss said.

The sad thing is that if he would have just worked the phrase &#8220;God hates abortions!&#8221; in to his ramblings he would still be a free man as it would have been impossible to tell him from the rest of your average hard-core parishioners.
