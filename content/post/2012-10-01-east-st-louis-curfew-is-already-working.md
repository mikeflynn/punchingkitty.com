East St. Louis, or as we describe it to out-of-town friends &#8220;&#8230;I know it _sounds_ like part of this city, but it&#8217;s not. Totally different city.&#8221;, instituted a new curfew recently and it&#8217;s already paying dividends after four kids were arrested violating the curfew while trying to break in to a home.

> <span style="font-size: small;">Parks says the officer who caught them was out looking for minors breaking curfew.</span>
> 
> <span style="font-size: small;">The curfew was put in place earlier in the week after a wave of violence in the city including the shooting deaths of three young men last weekend.</span>

The curfew was put in to place because of a &#8220;wave of violence&#8221;&#8230;that apparently everyone over there just now noticed? Can some one that works over in the East St. Louis mayor&#8217;s office describe to us the moment that **Mayor Alvin Parks** looked up and said &#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous! &#8230;that&#8217;s the answer to 34 down &#8216;Absurd, as in how you would describe anyone&#8217;s decision to live in East St. Louis&#8217;. Finally! Also it says here next to the crossword puzzle that crime is getting to be a problem. Who&#8217;s up for a curfew?!&#8221;

It&#8217;s great that the curfew is already leading to arrests, but you&#8217;d think there&#8217;d be even more since the curfew starts at 10 pm and goes until 9:30 pm the next day, giving the residents of East St. Louis a quick 30 minutes to run out and steal some groceries. That seems rough, but it&#8217;s the only curfew time that made sense considering it&#8217;s never a safe time to go out in East St. Louis. Sunday nights are the worst though because if you have to go out at 9:30, you&#8217;ll miss the end of _The Mentalist_. You&#8217;ll just never know if this is the week he doesn&#8217;t figure out who the murderer was at the end, and then say something funny to lighten the mood and make his gruff partner roll her eyes and be all like &#8220;This guy! &#8230;I&#8217;m tough, but he manages to crack my hard exterior with his quips, fine detective work, and that great head of hair.&#8221;
