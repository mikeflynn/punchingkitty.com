Holy crap. What?! Um&#8230;how do we describe what just happend? Ok, here&#8217;s our best shot&#8230;

DJDHADKFDS!!!!KDSFASDFDS!!!??SDKFASDF;ADSMCMAEJEHEIE.S,AALALDLDLD!!!!!!!!!

Not bad.

Here&#8217;s a better description <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=321012120" target="_blank">from ESPN</a>:

> Erasing an early six-run hole in Game 5 slowly but surely, the defending World Series champion Cardinals got a tying two-out, two-run single from [Daniel Descalso][1] and a go-ahead two-run single from [Pete Kozma][2] in the ninth inning and came all the way back to beat the [Washington Nationals][3] 9-7 on Friday night and win their NL Division Series.
> 
> It was the largest comeback ever in a winner-take-all postseason game, according to STATS LLC. No other club in this sort of ultimate pressure situation had come back from more than four down.

The Cardinals, since the start of the 2011 playoffs have been in 6 for 6 in elimination games.

All of this makes Nationals Game 4 hero Jayson Werth sad (above). See the Rangers for when the Cardinal victims group therapy meetings take place.

**Update**: Thanks ESPN, but tell your website graphics guy to watch the game all the way until the end.
