> St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department responded to a report of a home invasion and shooting around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning. Investigators said five men attempted a home invasion at a residence in the 2200 block of Osage Street. A man inside the home, not the homeowner, said he was sleeping and awoke when someone opened his bedroom door and as five or six black males began shooting at him.
> 
> Hours later, around 5:30 a.m., St. Louis police said the house was invaded again. This time the homeowner was there. He told police three black males entered the house, displayed a gun and forced him into a room. The suspects reportedly took two televisions and other electronics from the home during this incident.

Poor bastard&#8217;s house had more black guys in it that night than Tara Reid.

One time I was accused of a home invasion.  It was just a misunderstanding.  I was walking down the street and I looked in the window and saw a woman passed out on her couch so I ran in to help her.  I couldn&#8217;t get her to wake up until I remembered my penis had the ability to bring girls back to life, so I started to &#8220;help&#8221; her and then on cue she started yelling and punching me&#8230;totally out of control.  Really uncalled for treated for her hero. Anyway, long story short&#8230;she was just sleeping.
