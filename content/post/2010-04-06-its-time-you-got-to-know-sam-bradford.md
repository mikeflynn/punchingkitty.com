It&#8217;s happening. All the signs are there. After the Rams signed only AJ Feeley, and the Redskins trading for McNabb, and yesterday&#8217;s news that Marc Bulger has been released, its clear the Rams are going to draft Sam Bradford in a few weeks with the #1 pick in the NFL draft.

Here are a few things to get you started in getting to know St. Louis&#8217; soon-to-be poster child of rich athletes.

For one, he&#8217;s not much for Facebook. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sam-Bradford/101002170547" target="_blank">This appears to be his fan page</a>, but after a few football promo pics, there isn&#8217;t much here. He makes up for his lack of posting with an acute ability to make friends though as he is up to nearly 30,000!

Does Bradford have a girlfriend? We aren&#8217;t sure, but we did find out his last known girlfriend was apparently one Kelsey Kurtz (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1179053617" target="_blank">here&#8217;s her private Facebook page</a>). She&#8217;s cute. Bring her to St. Louis Sammy!

We also know Sam Bradford likes Coldplay as we dug up a story on <a href="http://www.soonerfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124638" target="_blank">a Sooner message board</a> of someone running in to him at a Coldplay concert. Not sure how we feel about that.

To wrap up our intro to Sam Bradford, we have a video of an interview by the University of Oklahoma TV station (we use the term loosely):
