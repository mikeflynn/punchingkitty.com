There was a train wreck in De Soto, MO yesterday, but while it sounds horrible everything&#8217;s ok. No one was hurt, and when the guys got off the train to take a look at what happened, De Soto&#8217;s population nearly doubled. Unfortunately they&#8217;re stuck with cleaning up all the spilled cargo.

> Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad, said **the 58-car freight train was transporting ballast rock (the kind that lines railroad tracks)** from Iron Mountain, Mo., in St. Francois County to St. Louis when it derailed.

No way! You&#8217;re already on rail road tracks! Just smooth anything that spilled out with a rake and lets go get some lunch!

The only way to get rid of a train wreck faster would be to run a bath and leave some cocaine next to it.
