We didn&#8217;t care one bit about the news a few weeks back that sports talk host Tim McKernan, in conjunction with InsideSTL.com, was buying the first half of the day on the stumpy-towered 1380 AM, but we have to say, the usually funny Morning After show on 1380 has tanked recently.  The new focus on interviewing broads for another show has taken the time that was usually filled with actual talk about sports.

More and more we find ourselves flipping to Mike and Mike on competitor 101ESPN in the morning and sometimes even sitting through their seemingly endless commercial breaks.
