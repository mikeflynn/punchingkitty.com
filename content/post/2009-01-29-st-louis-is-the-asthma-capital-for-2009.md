First [chess][1], now this.

From [OzarkFirst.com][2]:

> The Gateway City is the most challenging place to live with asthma in the United States.
> 
> That&#8217;s according to a study by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, which ranks St. Louis as the number one asthma capital.
> 
> This unfavorable ranking is being blamed on the lack of public smoke-free laws, the higher than average pollen counts over the the previous year, and an increase in asthma deaths.

Actually, this makes sense I guess.  If you had asthma it would be kind of a bitch to live here.  You can&#8217;t go to a bar in town without a burly gentleman standing next to you smoking like a chimney, and the pollen totally sucks.  

I feel bad for you asthmatic people in the summer, with the smoke and pollen, coughing your ass off at the bar while I&#8217;m in the corner with a couple of fine bitches eating chicken wings by the bucket and doing body shots of blue cheese and tequila off the ladies while a team of well-trained midgets give me back rubs.

I&#8217;m ready for summer.
