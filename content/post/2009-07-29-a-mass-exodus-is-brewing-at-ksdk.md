>  ****&#8230;morale is way down there because of forced pay cuts everyone had to take last year.  That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve seen several resignations there in the last year and you&#8217;ll likely see a few more.

This recent reports matches what much of what me and others have heard for a while now:  No one is happy there.  We aren&#8217;t just talking about &#8220;I work in a dying media that is run by morons&#8221; pissed off, this is really pissed off.

All signs point to more and more senior people hitting the door and you getting told about the progress of Highway 40 by [a 21 year old guy like this][4].
