MSN recently named our very own Carl&#8217;s Drive-in <a href="http://local.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=24359575&page=2" target="_blank">one of America&#8217;s best burger joints</a>:

> Wash down a top-notch hamburger with a frosty mug of root beer brewed by owner Frank Cunetto. The secret to a great burger is getting it from the grill to the customer as fast as possible, says Cunetto, who&#8217;s spent 20-plus years slinging meaty rounds for the cherished few seats at his counter.
> 
> The menu&#8217;s short and includes fries, onion rings and made-by-hand milkshakes with an almost sippable consistency. Crisp-edged burgers are flat-grilled, with the double possessing the best meat-to-bun ratio.

As someone who has sat in those &#8220;cherished&#8221; seats, I can bestow a little advice, when you need to switch up from one of those burgers, go with the Curly-Q Dog (above).

Here&#8217;s more advice: Avoid the clapp.

One more: No matter  how hot you think she looks, adam&#8217;s apple = dude. Always.
