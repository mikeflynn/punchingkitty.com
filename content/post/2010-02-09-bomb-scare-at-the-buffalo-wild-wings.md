The Buffalo Wild Wings near Mid Rivers Mall in St. Peters was evacuated today after a bag with a &#8220;suspicious&#8221; device inside was found.

> St. Peters police and fire and the St. Charles County Bomb Squad were called to the restaurant at I-70 and Mid Rivers Mall about the suspicious bag around 10:00 a.m. inside the business.
> 
> All of the employees had to evacuate the building until the bag was removed.
> 
> No one was injured and the restaurant reopened after about an hour.

Turns out it was a Speed Stick.  Please people don&#8217;t just leave your deodorant laying around in St. Peters.  New things that smell &#8220;funny&#8221; scare them.

I&#8217;m kidding!  There&#8217;s nothing explicitly wrong with wanting to live in one of thousands of similar looking houses that are all equidistant from a Walgreens and a Red Robin.
