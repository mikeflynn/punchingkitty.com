> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in the spotlight or the limelight. I want to be what I am and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; says Ervin Himmighoefer, an 87-year-old World War IIveteran from Germantown, Illinois.

> If you ask Himmighoefer what he likes to do for fun he&#8217;ll tell you, &#8220;nothing.&#8221;

> &#8220;I just sit here and watch TV,&#8221; he says.

> Himmighoefer joined the Marine Corps during World War II and fought in one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific campaign: the Battle of Iwo Jima. Some 7,000 Americans were killed there and he was awarded a Purple Heart.

Honorary or not, its pretty hard not to get GED these days.  The guy that breaking in to your car right now has a damn High School education!  Tell us about how you got that Purple Heart gramps!

> &#8220;Well, I got blowed up and landed down on my head,&#8221; he says with emphasis.

I swear to you I did not make that quote up.

Frankly this guy sounds freaking awesome and as far as I&#8217;m concerned he&#8217;s living the dream, there is one little nagging question. Explain to me what an honorary HS degree will do for a old &#8220;colorful&#8221;, which we all know is a  euphemism for cussing a lot and slapping broad&#8217;s asses, that does nothing but watch TV?  Will this make him feel better about himself?  I betcha it won&#8217;t!  Will it help this guy get a job?  Not a chance.

Hell, even the honorary Harvard degrees are useless but at least you get to make a speech.  All this guy wants is a second pudding cup for dinner and to make sure the reporter leaves before &#8220;The Wheel&#8221; comes on.
