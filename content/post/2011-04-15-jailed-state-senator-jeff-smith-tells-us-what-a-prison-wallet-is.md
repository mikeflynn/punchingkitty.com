_(Photo: Jeff Smith, right, with one of the guys he met in prison I guess&#8230;wait, no. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bill_streeter/425614062/" target="_blank">Bill Streeter</a>.)_

Jeff Smith, the Missouri state senator who was jailed last year after being found that he lied to the feds during questioning about a conspiracy with Voters for Truth to run negative ads against opponent Russ Carnahan, has written a little piece about his time in the clink and in it he answers questions like &#8220;What does &#8216;get chalked&#8217; mean?&#8221;, &#8220;What&#8217;s a prison wallet?&#8221;, &#8220;Did he stab anyone or become someone&#8217;s bitch?&#8221; (Answers: &#8220;to be murdered&#8221;, &#8220;your butt&#8221; and &#8220;inconclusive&#8221;)

> A guard approached and escorted me to a bathroom without a door. Then another guard appeared. Gruff and morbidly obese, he spoke in a thick Kentucky drawl. “Stree-ip,” he commanded. I stripped.
> 
> “Tern’round,” he barked. I turned around.
> 
> “Open up yer prison wallet,” he ordered.
> 
> I looked at him quizzically.
> 
> “Tern’round and open yer butt cheeks.”
> 
> I complied.

We saw something like this in a movie once late at night&#8230;only it was two chicks and one of them was in prison for banging too many people and the other one had a black dildo instead of a police baton.

> When I arrived at my unit, I was the only white person, which immediately made me a source of curiosity.
> 
> “White-collar?” one guy asked.
> 
> “Yup.”
> 
> “What you done did?”
> 
> “Lied to the feds.”
> 
> “Damn, how they know?” asked another.
> 
> “One of my best friends was wired.”
> 
> A chorus of “Punk-ass motherfucker!”s rained down.
> 
> Then somebody said, “Dude _need_ to get chalked.” That was slang, I realized, describing a body at a crime scene.
> 
> The chorus went “Hmm-hmmmmm!”

What&#8217;s with the part at the end? “Hmm-hmmmmm!”? Was he in a group with <a href="http://bit.ly/gdhOfM" target="_blank">Jackee Harry</a> and <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/04/black-woman-attitude.jpeg?page=1" target="_blank">whoever this lady is</a>?

You can read the whole story on <a href="http://therecoveringpolitician.com/contributors/jeffs/second-act" target="_blank">The Recovering Politican</a>. The story is a lot like American History X except Smith isn&#8217;t a Skinhead and he neer mentions working in the laundry room&#8230;not sure if the bathroom scene lines up at all with Smith&#8217;s experience.
