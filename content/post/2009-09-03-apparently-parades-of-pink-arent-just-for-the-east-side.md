That just happened when I saw a news post for a &#8220;Parade of Pink&#8221;&#8230;its what what you think&#8230;its way way gayer.

> Members of the Wentville Firefighters Community Outreach will host a 7k run, a 1-mile walk and 1:30 p.m. “**Parade of Pink.**”
> 
> A pink firetruck will stop in Lake Saint Louis and Wentzville next month as part of a nationwide fund-raising tour for breast cancer research.
> 
> [The] fund-raising festival that will include a barbecue, a beer garden, events for children, a “pink pet” parade, raffles, a balloon launch and t-shirt sales.

I can never get my mind around how something so overtly gay that it includes a pink firetruck but can still be about boobs.

I should also mention that Punching Kitty headquarters has always offered free breast exams if you are hot&#8230;we&#8217;ll also grab your but if you think you might have cute ass cancer.
