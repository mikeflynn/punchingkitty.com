You should go vote right now&#8230;unless you&#8217;re going to vote for the opposite of what we voted for. If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re planning to do, then don&#8217;t&#8230;or wait, do vote, but did you hear about the change in voting where you have to write down who/what you want to vote for on&#8230;um&#8230;that napkin on your right&#8230;it&#8217;s on the floor&#8230;there it is. OK, write your stuff on there and then fold it up and turn it in to the nearest Arby&#8217;s. They&#8217;ll know what to do.
