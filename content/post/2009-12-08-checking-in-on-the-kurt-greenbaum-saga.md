No, nothing new (that we know of) has happened in Greenbaum-Gate, but word is still spreading out from just our little world of baseball and new highways:

The Globe and Mail has an op/ed piece on Greenbaum: &#8220;<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/ingram-2_0/when-comment-moderation-goes-too-far/article1368881/" target="_blank">When Comment Moderation Goes Too Far</a>&#8220;

The Huffington Post&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/18/kurt-greenbaum-man-loses_n_362406.html" target="_blank">article on it</a> is still getting comments.

Greenbaum&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/KGreenbaum" target="_blank">Twitter profile</a> is still blocked.

&#8230;and the 8th result on Google for &#8220;Kurt Greenbaum&#8221; is our friend at <a href="http://KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com" target="_blank">KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com</a>

In some ways it appears the sprinting monster that is the internet and found something else shiny and turned its attention to that, but I wouldn&#8217;t say all is clear yet.

Maybe Kurt will poke his head out in the new year and see if its still stormy out.
