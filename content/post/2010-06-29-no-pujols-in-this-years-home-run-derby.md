&#8230;probably something about the All-Star Game being in St. Louis last year had a little something to do with it as well.

> <span style="font-size: x-small;">&#8220;I don’t have any problem doing it, but I want to concentrate on the second half,&#8221; Pujols said. &#8220;I enjoyed every moment that I did it.  I don’t regret it, and that doesn’t mean I would never do it again. I wouldn’t mind doing it again. I just feel that right now, this is not the time. </span>&#8220;

**1st half of 2009:** 32 HRs and 87 RBIs

**2nd half of 2009:** 15 HRs and 48 RBIs

Though we have a hard time believing that his second half drop was all about the Home Run Derby (for instance: injury, or the fact he had a huge first-half), we see his point.

So who can we look forward too? Joe Mauer, A-Rod, Josh Hamilton? Who knows&#8230;but we have heard that Tony LaRussa has been making a case for Aaron Miles.

We&#8217;re kidding.

Hopefully&#8230;I mean who knows at this point.
