<div>
  Our fair city&#8217;s mayor loves him so social media, and he knows that people love to complain, so the other day he sent out a call on Twitter that went a little something like this:
</div>

> <div>
>   Which street that you regularly cross do you find most difficult?
> </div>

<div>
  The mayor got tons of answers back, that he posted on <a href="http://www.mayorslay.com/desk/display-print.asp?deskID=1369" target="_blank">his blog</a>.  Of course most of the reply tweets are crazy-hard to read because Twitter frowns on full words and sentence structure.  That&#8217;s ok though, our crack staff have gone through the posts and isolated the streets people hate to cross.
</div>

<div>
  Here&#8217;s the list:
</div>

  * Forest Park Parkway
  * Tucker
  * Washington
  * Grand
  * Euclid
  * Kingshighway
  * Oakland
  * Chesnut
  * 11th
  * Market
  * Southwest
  * Macausland
  * Arsenal
  * Manchester

No, thats the not list of every major street in the city of St. Louis, thats the list we pulled from the complaints.

So&#8230;

Your best bet in St. Louis is either to never leave your house, or get your poor ass a car.

Such a lovely city.
