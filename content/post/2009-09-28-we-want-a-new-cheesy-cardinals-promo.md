The Cardinals are officially in the playoffs again and after running across this promo from 1992 about 100 years of the Cardinals on  YouTube, it got me thinking:  Where are the new cheesy promos?!  I want to see Pujols and Holiday &#8220;playing&#8221; the trumpet.  I want to see Julio Lugo playing the kettle drums!  &#8230;maybe Tony throw down some bad dance moves!  Oh and one quick shot of Dave Duncan just standing there, arms folded, looking pissed.

Is that too much to ask?  Shouldn&#8217;t the Cardinals just make up one little song to help propel them through the playoffs?

Until they do, enjoy some some awesome cheesiness from KPLR in 1992:



Come to think of it, I think KPLR is the source of this.  When they lost the Cardinals, the cheesy promos left town.  Is there a Rich Gould factor at play here?
