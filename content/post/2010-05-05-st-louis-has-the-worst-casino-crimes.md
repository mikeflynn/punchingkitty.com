No one hits the big casinos ill-prepared. They have two drivers, a computer expert (for some reason), the muscle and the brains&#8230;at a minimum. Their schemes involve parachuting on to the roof, dropping in on a zip line, using smoke to see the lasers and then trying to get out with the money after two costume changes and stop to make some wonderfully phrased zinger to a pretty lady at one of the craps tables.

In St. Louis we see a guy that just won some money and try to just grab it from him and run.

> Trenette Ryland, 34, of the 1300 block of Summergate Parkway in St. Charles County, was charged Monday with stealing $5,366 from a 66-year-old man at Ameristar Casino, authorities said. Ryland is accused of grabbing the money from his shirt pocket while they were standing near a set of elevators early Thursday morning.

This was the best idea huh? Grab it and run?  Couldn&#8217;t you have at least tried to seduce him, or get him drunk? &#8230;no, you just decided to grab it and run.  The article doesn&#8217;t say exactly, but I bet she wasn&#8217;t even wearing a costume, probably just dressed in her usual trailer park garb, which I can only assume was a flannel shirt with the sleeves cut off and sweat pants with a stain.

Everyone knows the &#8220;grab it and run&#8221; idea only works on stealing chips from gas stations where the clerk is in the little bullet-proof bubble, and as my main dating technique in high school. Turns out in both cases to get what you want, it&#8217;s easier just to use a gun, but what&#8217;s the skill in that?
