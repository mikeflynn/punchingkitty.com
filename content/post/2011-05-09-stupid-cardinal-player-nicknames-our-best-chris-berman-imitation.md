Berman ruins the name of your favorite players like no one in the business. In the meantime, we can only pretend by making up long-form nicknames.

  Here are our best imitation as to what Berman would call some of the more prominent Cardinals:
</p>

**1.** Albert &#8220;I&#8217;m playing like _Poo_&#8221; _jols_

**2.** _Daniel _De_&#8230;&#8221;&#8230;uh&#8230;hold on, give me a second&#8230;shoot. I got nothin&#8217;.&#8221; _scalso__

**3.** Yadi &#8220;I sure could use a few _Mo_ hits&#8221; _lina_

**4.** David &#8220;I better _Freese_ because if I move I hurt myself&#8221;

**5.** Adam &#8220;Back in high school there was this guy named _Wain_. He was a pretty good guy, seemed nice enough, though I never really hung out with him much, and I&#8217;m pretty sure he was kinda stupid. I think he went in to the Army or something and I actually don&#8217;t remember him at graduation now that I think about it. So long story short, I heard a few years back that he got in some accident and it was in the paper and my mom was like &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know this guy?&#8221; and I was like &#8216;Yeah.&#8217; and then she was like he was like &#8220;You guy&#8217;s always hung out right?&#8221; and, you know mom&#8217;s, I&#8217;m all like &#8220;No!&#8221;. I never did hear, but I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s all&#8221; _wright_ &#8220;Oh, yeah he played baseball.&#8221;
