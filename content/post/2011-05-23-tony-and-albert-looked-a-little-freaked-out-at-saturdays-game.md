What the hell had **Albert Pujols** and **Tony LaRussa** so spooked in these <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/" target="_blank">Getty Image</a> photos from Saturday&#8217;s game versus the **Kansas City Royals**?

**A:** It was just at that moment that someone realized that the freaking [Rod Barajas][2] is currently out-hitting Pujols.

**B:** They were both just told that the new movie &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttv-gvOzaPw" target="_blank">Beaver</a>&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly what they thought it was, and was actually about a crazy old racist actor trying to make a comeback with a puppet, instead of what we all really want to see him do to turn his career around, _<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099005/" target="_blank">Air America</a> 2_.

**C:** Teammate **Lance Berkman**, possibly over-doing it a bit, decided to lighten the clubhouse mood by doing that thing from _Silence of the Lambs_ where the guy has a wig, lipstick and a silk robe on while pushing his junk between his legs and asking if anyone would &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqfY6KyEHvU" target="_blank">f*ck me so hard</a>&#8220;? _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Yeah, that&#8217;s a link to the clip. NSFW-ish.]_ The stunt was off-putting from the front, but Tony and Albert were standing behind him.

**D:** Can&#8217;t. Look. Away. Hypnotized. By. Arm. Fat. Just let them score two so she&#8217;ll put her arms down!
