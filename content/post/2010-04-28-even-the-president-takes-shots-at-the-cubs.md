Obama, quite the sports fan himself, couldn&#8217;t help himself from taking a shot at the woeful Cubs while standing with the winningest organization of them all.

> &#8220;It&#8217;s been nine years since your last title, which must have felt like an eternity for Yankees fans,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;I think other teams would be just fine with a spell like that &#8212; the Cubs, for example.

Now sure, Obama&#8217;s Cubs hate is from the fact that he&#8217;s a White Sox fan, but we&#8217;ll take that. They say your enemies of your enemies are your friends or something right? Well then there you go.

You may not like his health plan, or the fact that he ruined you and your supremacist buddies&#8217; &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill myself if a black guy gets in the White House&#8221; threat, but we can all agree: **Screw the Cubs.**
