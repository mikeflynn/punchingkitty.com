The Cardinals had the day off yesterday which worked out well since the annual charity golf tournament put on by the Pujols Foundation was yesterday and putting out a &#8220;sorry everyone is at work&#8221; would have made for a lame &#8220;celebrity&#8221; golf game over at the swank St. Alben&#8217;s course.

In attendance were Shaq, Tony LaRussa&#8217;s good buddy, Bob Knight, Bo Jackson, Ozzie Smith,  Mark McGwire and of course all the usual Cardinal teammates. &#8230;which includes Ryan Franklin (below).

No the Cardinal closer isn&#8217;t standing behind the South County hoosier, that&#8217;s him, front and center.

We aren&#8217;t yet sure how long he had to stand still like that to get the bees to make a hive of that size on his chin.
