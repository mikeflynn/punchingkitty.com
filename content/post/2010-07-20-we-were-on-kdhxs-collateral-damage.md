We talked about the origins of this very website, the best place to find genitalia on the internet, the rarely spoken topic of our little &#8220;blogging break&#8221; last year and our various battles with local &#8220;celebrities&#8221;.

The whole show is <a href="http://kdhx.org/ondemand/collateraldamage/2010/07/19/stl-blogosphere/" target="_blank">posted online for your listening pleasure on KDHX.org</a>.
