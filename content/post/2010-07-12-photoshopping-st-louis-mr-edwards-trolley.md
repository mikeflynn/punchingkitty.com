It looks like <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=206859&catid=3" target="_blank">Mr. Joe Edwards is getting his trolley</a>!

> [T]he federal government is pitching in $25-million toward a trolley car that would run between University City and western parts of St. Louis.
> 
> This $44-million total project would run trolley cars between City Hall down Delmar, then south on Debaliviere to the Missouri history museum on Debaliviere in Forest park.

For a while it looked like it may never happen, but now it looks like it could be in place as soon as 2012, according to Edwards.

We love Joe, who has always been very nice to us, because we love what he has done for the Loop area, but this Photoshopping idea just wouldn&#8217;t leave our heads and when the news of the $25 million government grant came down it was time to finally make _our_ dream come true of turning Joe in to &#8220;Mr. Edwards&#8221;.

&#8230;the only difference being that when Joe&#8217;s trolley takes off it doesn&#8217;t go to a magical kingdom, it goes past 2 closed gas stations and a Wellfare office.
