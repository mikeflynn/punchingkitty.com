A man attempted to rob an O&#8217;Fallon, Missouri gas station holding only box cutters&#8230;and it worked somehow.

> Authorities say a man walked into the Phillips 66, 2700 Technology Drive, near Interstate 64 about 10 a.m., threatened a clerk with box cutters and demanded cash.
> 
> The man ran out with less than $200 and hopped into a car believed to be a Honda Civic waiting outside, authorities said. No one was hurt.

How did this work? &#8220;Give me some money or I&#8217;ll stab you with this really short knife? &#8230;you know, the kind of cut you get when you are opening a box and  you slip and hit your finger. Those really sting and make it hard to type for a couple of days. The cost of little band-aids alone is daunting I&#8217;m sure, so just give me $200 bucks and I&#8217;ll be on my way.&#8221;

Only in St. Charles would a plan like that work. Try that crap with any city gas station and the clerk will laugh at you, show you his old wounds and then shoot you. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a knife wound&#8230;_this_ is a knife wound!&#8221; Bam. You&#8217;re dead. Seriously, take your little box cutters to a North City Shell station and you let me know how that turns out. You probably won&#8217;t even get the chance to threaten the clerk because the guy robbing the place just before you entered would shoot you first with his semi-automatic weapon. Don&#8217;t worry, the guy that robs the place just _after_ you should push you aside, or at least step over you, to get to the clerk, which is just common courtesy. If you didn&#8217;t have that, how could you effectively rob every gas station 5 times a day? You couldn&#8217;t, it would be a logistical nightmare!
