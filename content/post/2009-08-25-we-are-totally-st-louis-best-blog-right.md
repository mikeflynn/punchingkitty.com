I mean look at all we&#8217;ve done for you!  Remember that thing we got  you that one time?  What about that time you were so drunk and we helped you do that thing you couldn&#8217;t do?   &#8230;and don&#8217;t think we forgot about helping you bury that dead you-know-what in the woods because you just _had_ to try that one thing out on her when you were all whacked out on that stuff!

[Vote][2] and we won&#8217;t tell a soul.

Love ya!

[RFT&#8217;s Best of St. Louis 2009][2]
