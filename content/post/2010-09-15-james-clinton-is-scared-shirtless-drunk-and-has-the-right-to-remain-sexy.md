In one of the finest mugshots to come out of the St. Louis area in some time (No, its not better than <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/20/dan-mclaughlin-gets-busted-for-drinky-drinky-drivey-drivey/" target="_blank">Dan McLaughlin&#8217;s</a>.) we have James Clinton, arrested for DUI and driving with a suspended license.

There&#8217;s no doubt from the look on Jimmy&#8217;s face that the Police have finally rolled out their &#8220;Make All Arrests Watch KSDK&#8217;s Local News Broadcast with Leisa Zigman&#8221; program. Seems to be unnecessarily cruel though.
