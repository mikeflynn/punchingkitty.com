There&#8217;s a $20 million dollar, taxpayer-funded community center in North St. Louis and no one&#8217;s using it. Why? At first we thought it was because it&#8217;s in North City and there&#8217;s probably some scary gang hanging out by the front door, which still might be true, but the actual reason is because the door is locked over political fighting between **Mayor Slay** and **Alderman Antonio French**.

Here&#8217;s the short version: French doesn&#8217;t want the rec center to open until his demands for a better deals for his residents are met, and the Mayor disagrees and doesn&#8217;t want to lose to &#8220;French&#8221; people.

> &#8220;The mayor and his people want to get it open just to say they got it open,&#8221; French said. &#8220;We want to get it open in a way in which as many people as possible can use it.&#8221;
> 
> Slay&#8217;s staff has scrambled to meet French&#8217;s demands. The mayor&#8217;s chief of staff, Jeff Rainford, says there is no political dispute, just the mayor working to open the center and French attacking him at each turn.
> 
> &#8220;If he wants to be impetuous and angry — that&#8217;s like a little child,&#8221; Rainford said recently of French. &#8220;He hates the mayor and is trying to make the mayor look bad in north St. Louis.&#8221;

French wants the nice new center, run by employees rather that volunteers, and offer lots of opportunity for free or low cost memberships&#8230;and a pony, which he will name Buttercup. The Mayor thinks those demands are a little high and instead would rather open the center now and see how it goes&#8230;but that&#8217;s only because he hates black people according to this angry black woman:

> &#8220;It&#8217;s a black neighborhood, that&#8217;s what the problem is,&#8221; said Eliza Brown, 70, after a recent neighborhood meeting in French&#8217;s 21st Ward. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing but black kids and black folks over here. Don&#8217;t mean nothing to (Slay). He&#8217;s not in this neighborhood. He don&#8217;t know about us. Low income, and he really don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s just that simple.&#8221;

Not sure about that, but there is something oddly familiar about this story. Familiar enough to know there&#8217;s only one solution to a problem consisting of old guys in suits fighting over a community center: We need to get everyone in the neighborhood together and protest our corrupt politicians via a slow building street dance that will eventually get somewhere and then maybe somehow that will translate in to a situation where we raise enough money to save the community center you guys! The details are a little sketchy at this point and at least one of us should probably not dress like a jackass so we can have an adult conversation, but to say what you believe in sometimes you must fight (by &#8220;fight&#8221; we mean dance in costumes involving a lot of mesh shirts and fingerless gloves&#8230;and by &#8220;say what you believe in&#8221; we mean use <a href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/b5/5b5e4882-578a-5961-9193-1d03a675db6d/5051e5bce8d13.preview-620.jpg" target="_blank">that bitchin&#8217; rec center water slide</a>)

Ok, now who&#8217;s going to start on the costumes?! Dibs on choreography!
