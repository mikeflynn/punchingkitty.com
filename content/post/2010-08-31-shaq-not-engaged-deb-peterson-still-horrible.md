Looks like Hoopz didn&#8217;t get a ring in St. Louis after all!

The site GossipCop.com got what we couldn&#8217;t: A response from Shaq&#8217;s people about his possible engagement in St. Louis a few weekends ago (&#8220;[Shaq Proposed to His Girlfriend in St. Louis][2]&#8220;):

> **Gossip Cop** reached out to O’Neal’s rep, who told us the engagement rumors are “not accurate.”
> 
> Repeat: He is _not_ engaged.
> 
> When asked for a comment, the _Post-Dispatch_ writer noted that she “did not say he’s engaged,” but simply shared what the restaurant owner thought he witnessed. She also acknowledged she didn’t reach out to O’Neal’s rep to fact-check David’s claim.
> 
> We’re calling a foul on this one.

Dammit. Yeah, we&#8217;ll take this one for following Peterson&#8217;s lead.

Here&#8217;s one thing from our original story we&#8217;re sticking to, no matter how many agents GossipCop calls:

> Word is that after Shaq and Hoopz’ magical wedding night is all just a stain, ‘Flav has plans to live in the newly hollowed out part of Hoopz. It will be like Webster hiding in that dumbwaiter. So cute!

Honestly, we just wanted to post the picture of Hoopz again&#8230;
