Prepare to start living&#8230;_really_ living!

Opening in Soulard &#8220;soon&#8221;, there aren&#8217;t much in the way of details about the &#8220;Sultry Donut&#8221;. <a href="http://thesultrydonut.com/" target="_blank">Their website</a> has a bunch of nothing and this:

> The Sultry Donut and Café is opening up soon!! Check back for latest renovation pictures, future menu items and pictures of our staff. The Sultry Donut Shop and Café features beautiful women dressed in scantily clad clothing, dressing up for our daily themes, such as Military Monday, Bikini Wednesday, and Fantasy Friday. You will also be able to offer our suggestions for Suggestion Saturday, where you, the customer, get to choose what the girls dress up as. Our hours are 5:00A.M. to 11:30 A.M Monday through Saturday. We are located in the heart of Soulard and hope to see you soon!

Here&#8217;s hoping for &#8220;Nothing but Powdered Sugar Tuesday&#8221;!

Here&#8217;s double hoping that when they say &#8220;beautiful women&#8221; they mean beautiful on the outside and not &#8220;Oh come on, don&#8217;t be so mean. She&#8217;s lovely!&#8221; emo chicks that want to sell donuts and pretend they are Suicide Girls. Not going to cut it. Not sure if they are hot? Ask us! We&#8217;re here to help.

Also of note is that, apparently, you can order online, in case you don&#8217;t want to go to Krispy Creme, and would rather just miss the whole point of this place.

We&#8217;ll keep you updated with anything we find out, but one thing is for sure: First one through the door with a joke about putting your penis through the donut hole gets a high five!
