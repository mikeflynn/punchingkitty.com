I&#8217;m not here to be that guy that tells everyone that racism doesn&#8217;t exist any more.  It totally does and seen plenty of it with my own eyes.  This however, isn&#8217;t it:

  Maybe these people are racists, maybe they really do hate black people and they went through the trouble to actually pick out white old people for their ads, but if thats the case, bring it forward!

  In case your were wondering, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">actual racist</span> lady looked through ads until she found one with a black lady in it and put her father in there.  I hope she remembered to check if there were any old people with stupid, fame-whoring daughters in the ads, because if not, you have another chance for your name in paper one more time!
