> The Rally Saint Louis project is a first-of-its-kind crowdsourcing and crowdfunding platform that generates ideas and uses funding from the region’s residents and then uses those ideas to help market greater Saint Louis.  It has been over a year in the making, and it&#8217;s an effort unlike anything ever attempted, not just in the Saint Louis region, but across the U.S.

Interesting idea. We just hope there are more to the submissions than various hipster activities, and instead see some trying to focus on the big issues standing in the way of making the city considerably more livable: crime, education or swapping out our stale area government officials for shiny new ones.
