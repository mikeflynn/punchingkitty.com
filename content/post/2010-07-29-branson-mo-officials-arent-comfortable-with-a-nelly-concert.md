For the second time, officials for country music mecca Branson, MO have denied a proposed concert by rapper and St. Louis native, **Nelly**.

> Concert organizer Paul Dunn announced on July 4 that Nelly would perform as part of the reopening of the Grand Palace. But the city on July 9 denied a special event permit, citing concerns about parking, crowd control and noise.

This make perfect sense since Branson isn&#8217;t set up for concerts. I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s played music there ever actually. And parking? Totally agree. Branson is definitely a rap kinda town, so there would of course be a parking situation.

Oh and Nelly&#8217;s a black guy that last I checked doesn&#8217;t hold an acoustic guitar.

During the Alderman meeting, one old white guy shouted &#8220;Yeah! And if you bring that Metrolink out here, the crime with just come with it!&#8221;

&#8220;Jerry? We&#8217;re talking about a different issue, probably also seated in racism.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh sorry. Everybody. &#8230;Parking will be a nightmare!&#8221;

&#8220;Good save.&#8221;
