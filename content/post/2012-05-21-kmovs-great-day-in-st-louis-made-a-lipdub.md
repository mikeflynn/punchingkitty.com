Friday afternoon we got this via Twitter:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13667" title="greatdaystl_tweet" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/greatdaystl_tweet.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="178" />][1]

What&#8217;s this? KMOV&#8217;s Great Day in St. Louis is sending us video links now? What could it be? They said they had fun making it, so it couldn&#8217;t be a link to one of their local news broadcasts as no one has fun reading off St. Louis&#8217; nightly murder list. We were really hoping it was going to be grainy night-vision footage of Kent Ehrhardt leaving a bag of flaming poo on Dave Murray&#8217;s doorstep, but after we clicked it turned out to be a &#8220;lipdub&#8221;&#8230;kinda.

Here it is:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3ojsRQE0cWg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

No one really mouths along to all the words, and it&#8217;s not the full song, but it&#8217;s close enough and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/03/25/drunken-st-louis-lipdub-bohemian-rhapsody/" target="_blank">we&#8217;re suckers for posting lipdubs</a>. Ok, we&#8217;ll take the bait. Lets break this thing down!

It&#8217;s your basic &#8220;do crazy stuff in the office&#8221; deal with a peppy song. It&#8217;s weird, but we&#8217;ll give them points for doing it and hopefully the other local news stations won&#8217;t follow. Maybe KTVI (Fox) could pull it off if was just April Simpson, but KSDK (NBC) won&#8217;t be able to since **Mike Bush** is way to serious, **Cusumano** would be worried about his hair falling off the whole time, and **Leisa Zigman**&#8216;s nose isn&#8217;t safe being around all those waving arms.

As for the lipdub at hand, what we have here is four groups cut together with varying degrees of &#8220;giving a crap&#8221;:

**1.** The behind the scenes staff. &#8212; This was probably their idea since they are way more in to it that most of the other groups. Their&#8217;s even choreography with the rolling chair deal, and props like the mustaches and wigs.

**2.** The morning news anchors &#8212; In to it, definitely dancing around, but not enough that their going to do anything than jump around in their little gas station outfits (What&#8217;s that about? &#8230;never mind, we don&#8217;t want to know.) and serve as black and white b-roll.

**3.** Virginia Kerr &#8212; &#8230;who is really really really in to this. If she could just do this for her job, we&#8217;re pretty sure she would. Actually, she kinda _does_ do this for her job, it&#8217;s just the background music is turned up and she gets to wear a silver wig this time.

**4.** The evening news anchors &#8212; They could not want to be less involved in this. Three of them just did a little &#8220;smile and wink&#8221; appearance to be good sports (Connors, Ehrhardt, and Savard), but the leader of the &#8220;get away from me, don&#8217;t you know I&#8217;m on the local evening news!&#8221; Patrol was Jasmine Huda, who couldn&#8217;t even put the phone down to deliver her best &#8220;leave me alone&#8221; smile and wave.

&#8230;which brings us to the animated gifs we pulled from this (click the more link to see them and read the rest). <!--more-->There were really so many different things you can do with a video like this on a site like ours, but since the evening talent seemed to not want to be involved that much, it just seemed right to make sure we pulled a animated gif of their brief cameos that will live on the internet forever.

&#8220;**Steve Savard** showing his karate skills&#8221;:

&#8220;**Jasmine Huda** politely (and cutely) tells you to leave&#8221;:

&#8220;**Kent** thinks you crazy!&#8221;:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13669" title="kmov_kent_crazy" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_kent_crazy.gif" alt="" width="480" height="320" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_kent_crazy.gif 480w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_kent_crazy-150x100.gif 150w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />][4]

&#8220;**Larry Connors** thinks you&#8217;re awesome.&#8221;:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13668" title="kmov_larry_ydmd" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_larry_ydmd.gif" alt="" width="480" height="320" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_larry_ydmd.gif 480w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/05/kmov_larry_ydmd-150x100.gif 150w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />][5]

No matter what you thought about the video, that Larry Connors gif makes it all worth while. We&#8217;ve been playing it on a loop since we made it. It&#8217;s like Larry is lifting us up! We want to by a bunch of &#8220;Footprints&#8221; posters, but change all the Jesus mentions to Larry Connors.

There you go KMOV. Enjoy the review, and feel free to call our people so we can set up an appearance on &#8220;Great Day&#8221; soon. We can&#8217;t do your usual stuff like telling people how to remove varicose veins and which swim suit is the most flattering, but you can count on us to make gagging sounds throughout each of those two segments. Maybe we can make scrambled eggs or something, we&#8217;ll work it out.
