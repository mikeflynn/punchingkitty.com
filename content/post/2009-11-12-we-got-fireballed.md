Later on yesterday you may have seen the site be&#8230;a little slow.  Ok, the site was freaking dead.  But it was the best kind of dead since our baseball post was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/11/11/updated-revenue-payroll-stats" target="_blank">linked to</a> from one of our favorite blogs <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>.  So awesome.  Of course the problem lies in that its not just our favorite blog, its a lot of people&#8217;s favorite blog so our site got what for some time has been known as being &#8220;fireballed.&#8221;

To get a handle on the type of traffic our site was under yesterday, allow me to show you this graph:

That point in the middle there, where the server was running a full _400%_ more load that usual is when it was posted.

Having your sever melt before our eyes, never felt so good.
