So your medical opinion is that the reason is needed to go to the bathroom this morning, was not a food baby, but because I was having an actual baby? Interesting. Can I get a second opinion?_

Here&#8217;s one: You&#8217;re also, pretty clearly, retarded.

No joking. That actually happened yesterday morning. In St. Louis. For reals.

> A Florissant, Missouri, woman went to the bathroom Tuesday and ended up having a baby. Jane Calvin says she didn&#8217;t even know she was pregnant. She screamed for help. Mark Loving, the baby&#8217;s father, was in the next room and was stunned to find the tiny girl. He grabbed a towel and called 911.
> 
> Calvin says, “I went into shock because I had no clue really, what just happened because I just freaked out.”

WTF? This can&#8217;t really&#8230;dude. No way. This is so stupid. How do you not know you&#8217;re pregnant?! When the kid ends up spending the majority of his time in preschool bangin his head in to the ground and drooling on herself you&#8217;re gonna wish you would have popped for the pregnancy pee stick instead of going out all those times over the last nine months.

> They considered several names, including Faith, Grace and Destiny.  They named her &#8220;Faith&#8221;. Both parents believe she is a miracle.

Miracle seems like a strong word for this. Pretty sure she won&#8217;t think of it that way when someone in her middle school runs across this story. Frankly, they should have just _not_ named her. It will make her much more attractive to her just-a-matter-of-time adopted parents if they can have the honor.

By the way, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1414029121&sk=info" target="_blank">this looks like the &#8220;mother&#8217;s&#8221; Facebook page</a> which sadly has no updates that we can see, but if you&#8217;re her friend we&#8217;re guessing it goes a little something like:

> Hey ya&#8217;ll! Man my back hurts today&#8230;has for a few months now.
> 
> Man I&#8217;m lactating a lot lately. FML.
> 
> Ok! Who spilled water underneath me? Not funny.
> 
> Wow I must really have to fart! This is the worst gas pain ever and it&#8217;s coming like every 10 minutes&#8230;
