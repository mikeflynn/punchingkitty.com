Each year we like to scour YouTube and find the best uploads of drunkenness because we know you kids love the social media these days (&#8220;social media&#8221; is a fancy term for sexting and comparing who go the most wasted without having to be in the same room. We live in the future!).

#### #5 &#8211; Guy Falls During Parade (by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mdfoley75?feature=watch" target="_blank">mdfoley75</a>)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/bydUmPNJlyg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

We&#8217;re guessing that this guy wasn&#8217;t even drunk, which is why it&#8217;s at #5&#8230;but we&#8217;re totally sure it&#8217;s funny, so it made the list.

#### #4 &#8211; The Drunken Mardi Gras Montage (by <a dir="ltr" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Naylor217?feature=watch" data-sessionlink="ei=P34aUeyzMYrJiQLE3AE&feature=watch">Naylor217</a>)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/dmJuGC4UwGo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

We dislike the YouTube montage because people generally don&#8217;t cut down the clips enough and they tend to drag on way too long. This one doesn&#8217;t stray from that mold, but it&#8217;s still has some funny parts.

#### #3 &#8211; Where the Drunk Guy Punches Cop in the Face! (by <a dir="ltr" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/leaknews1?feature=watch" data-sessionlink="feature=watch&ei=VYAaUaDZNISxiwLg24H4Dg">leaknews1</a>)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/txMxrsSFlMg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Here&#8217;s how it goes down: While arresting someone, the cops get a bottle thrown at them. They figure out who it was (little guy in red hat) and when they start talking to him little red hat guy starts throwing punches! You gotta admire his spunk&#8230;in that you can&#8217;t wait to watch him get beat down.

#### #2 &#8211; The video with two girls dancing that YouTube Removed

We watched it and it wasn&#8217;t hot enough to be removed. It was worth a #2 while it was up though.

#### #1 &#8211; The Mardi Gras Dance Off! (by <a dir="ltr" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/314ramsey?feature=watch" target="_blank" data-sessionlink="ei=un4aUcPqKe_OigLowYBQ&feature=watch">314ramsey</a>)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WMI25hS_7jc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Who seems the most drunk: The two doing a dance off in the middle of Mardi Gras? Or the guy filming the whole thing sideways?

We&#8217;ll never know.
