_&#8216;Fro-less **Update**: The Rams have passed. No Randy Moss for the Rams. Source: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5760968" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a>_

_Original story follows&#8230;_

**Randy Moss** has always been one of the most talented wide receivers in the National Football League&#8230;when he wants to be. This year alone, he&#8217;s been sent packing from two teams, the Patriots and Vikings. Being cut from the Vikings after only four weeks has cleared the way so that by 4pm today, he could be a St. Louis Ram.

<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5752939" target="_blank">From ESPN.com</a> (emphasis added):

> A team can claim Moss and pick up the final year of a contract that pays him $6.4 million in base salary. Winless Buffalo has the worst record in the league and the first shot to claim Moss, followed by Carolina and Dallas. If no team claims him, the Vikings owe Moss the remaining $3.388 million on his deal. He&#8217;d be available for around $450,000 and Moss could choose the team he would like to join.
> 
> Various league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Chicago Bears, **St. Louis Rams,** Miami Dolphins, Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets and even the Patriots are among the teams possibly interested in claiming Moss.

So we&#8217;re confused. Two teams have ran from this guy like he&#8217;s a topless Snookie this year but then there are teams, including the Rams, lining up to get him. What the hell happened?!

It all started like this, a long time ago (4 weeks), far far away (New England)&#8230;

Randy was on the Patriots and everyone was happy, then this year started and Randy didn&#8217;t have a new contract yet, this makes Randy sad:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/X2Q38p1VXrY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

As you can see above, Randy came out in a press conference and said that people in New England hate him, and he&#8217;s probably gone at the end of the year. To which the Patriots said &#8220;We can do better than that! How about we just send your ass out of here right now! Hey Brett Favre?! You want him&#8221; to which Brett said &#8220;What?! I&#8217;m busy!&#8221; dropped his phone, tucked his junk back in his Wranglers, and the Vikings took Randy in a trade.

Randy came over to the Vikings and was pretty much a dick to a lot of people, didn&#8217;t really play all that well, and then, on Halloween Sunday, had another one of those press conferences:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/aALERIngeS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

&#8230;where he bitched about the Vikings, who actually do suck pretty bad, and how much he missed New England. We guess they didn&#8217;t hate him up there _that_ much after all, which is good, because the Vikings said, &#8220;If you love them so much, lets just trade you right back! &#8230;wait no, we can&#8217;t. Ok, just leave then.&#8221;

Do the Rams take Randy Moss in now, after all that, to help out their busted-ass receiving corps? Maybe. He is a good player, but he&#8217;s also a giant douche at times. This is a thinker, and it may not even matter if a crappier team than the Rams makes a claim first, but if those 12 teams take a pass, he can be all ours for roughly $4 Million dollars!

You know what? We say take him! I might hurt us, it might help us, but we do know it will be funny as hell having the guy that got **Joe Buck**&#8216;s panties in a knot a few years ago when he _fake_ mooned the crowd, playing for his hometown team!
