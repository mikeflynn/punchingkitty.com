We are starting a little thing here on Punching Kitty: The Random Interview!  Do I really have to explain it?  Ok, fine.  Its a interview with a random person.

We got some response on Twitter when we asked for anyone that wanted to be interviewed, and this was the first response we got back!  More of these are coming since 1. its a cool spotlight on people and 2. its one less post idea I have to come up with when its a slow news day!  Everyone wins!

If you want to be interviewed randomly, shoot a request over to editor@punchingkitty.com and we&#8217;ll fill your (in)box with some hot custom question goodness and you&#8217;ll be all like &#8220;Hell yeah!&#8221; &#8230;unless you are a dude, then you will probably be like &#8220;What the hell man?&#8221;  and I&#8217;ll be like &#8220;Shit, sorry.&#8221; &#8230;or  you won&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s ok too.

On with today&#8217;s interview!

> tie)

**PK:** _This morning I was driving to work through the city stuck behind this
  
douche that waited for every damn light to turn red! Took me forever to get
  
to work! So lame. I mean, thats fine if you aren&#8217;t trying to get anywhere
  
but damn, get the hell out of the way. As you can see I&#8217;m still totally
  
pissed about it. What&#8217;s your favorite color and why?_

> gonna go with Superman/Wonderwoman. But then my wife got pregnant.
  
> With boy/girl twins. So, The Skywalker family, naturally. Pre-Darth
  
> Vader Anakin, Padme, Luke and Leia. Yes, I am a huge nerd. My wife is

> Nightmare Before Christmas

**PK:** _Don&#8217;t think about it! Best album ever?! Go!_

> You don&#8217;t know the kind of pain this question causes&#8230; Top of my
