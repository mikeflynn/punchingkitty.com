Driving down Forest Park Parkway, the &#8220;intra-city 40&#8221;, and a truck pulls in ahead of us.

  Seems small though. Can&#8217;t figure out what&#8217;s wrong with this thing, but something is off. Wait a minute&#8230;that&#8217;s a Ford Escort&#8230;that is a Ford Escort <em>truck</em>!  &#8230;which aren&#8217;t supposed to exist and thus are like a chick with a third boob. You know, like at first you hear about it and you are like &#8220;Whoa! Three boobs?! That sounds awesome&#8230;and then you get there and after looking at it, its not quite right and makes everything look off because they aren&#8217;t lined up horizontally, but the third one is aligned vertically with the right boob making her look like some sort of weird dog girl which isn&#8217;t what you were hoping.  &#8230;maybe if there were four and she was evened out&#8230;no, even then, its just wrong and your dreams and expectations tempered like so many Saved by the Bell-themed wet dreams after watching Showgirls.

Have you ever really needed a truck but only had an old 4-door car? Lets say you did. Now let me ask you this: In that situation, would you think to yourself &#8220;Well I&#8217;ve got a shit-load of time on my hands! Lets just make a truck out of my Ford Escort!&#8221;

No. You wouldn&#8217;t think that. This guy did though. Thought it. Did it. &#8230;and now he is legend.

More photos after the jump!
