Here are something little things of note going on around St. Louis that really didn&#8217;t deserve a post of their own:

<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=5065422" target="_blank">Keith Tkachuk has announced his retirement</a>. &#8230;oh you might not know who he is. He played for the Blues. &#8230;the Blues are a hockey team. &#8230;They play in St. Louis.  &#8230;It&#8217;s the MetroLink stop just west of Busch Stadium. &#8230;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey" target="_blank">This is what hockey is</a>.

We have <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/crime/Teacher-accused-of-committing-sex-crime-involving-teen-boy-in-St-Louis-90100082.html" target="_blank">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Prof-pleads-not-guilty-in-child-porn-case-90159972.html" target="_blank">perverts</a> in this town.

Prop A passes and Metrolink says whew&#8230;<a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/apr/07/metrolink-train-malfunctions-expect-delays/" target="_blank">we can stop trying to be good at what we do now</a>.

<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2010/04/05/daily45.html?surround=lfn" target="_blank">Everyone look at me!</a> My story is old and stupid but if I wait just long enough to do something else with the thing I found in the trash people can still see <a href="http://assets.bizjournals.com/story_image/855131-0-0-1.jpg" target="_blank">my Glamour Shot</a> in the newspaper!

Shame on you St. Louis for getting rid of a freaking junk yard in the middle of what is supposed to be a real city. <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/laworder/story/40C153118DB2C34A862576FF000E7926?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Give them $1 Million dollars please.</a>

I know when I feel our country is in trouble I think to myself, &#8220;<a href="http://interact.stltoday.com/blogzone/letters-to-the-editor/letters-to-the-editor/2010/04/civil-war-reenactors-could-push-peace-now/" target="_blank">How can Civil War re-enactors be helping?</a>&#8221; &#8230;oh wait. Nevermind. I&#8217;ll just watch &#8220;Glory&#8221; on Netflix.
