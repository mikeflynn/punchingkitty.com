We aren&#8217;t usually one to self-aggrandize, but we do want you all to know that our fearless and sexy editor, Mike Flynn, will be on the panel for this month&#8217;s Social Media Club talk at the Pepper Lounge this Thursday the 17th (tomorrow!).  The topic will be &#8220;Old Media vs New Media&#8221;

The event is free, so come because you love Punching Kitty (get your ass some [stickers][2]!), come because you hate Punching Kitty, or at least come because we are talking &#8220;Old Media&#8221; and you know we _always_ have the best things to say about them on here!

If you really can&#8217;t come or you aren&#8217;t in town, they will be streaming the talk on UStream, so if we remember, we&#8217;ll post that link here when its all going down.
