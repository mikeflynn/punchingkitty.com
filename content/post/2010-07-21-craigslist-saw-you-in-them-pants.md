Oh you sweet talker you! What&#8217;s this? Did our panties just drop?! Damn we knew we shouldn&#8217;t have worn our loosest pair of panties while going through <a href="http://stlouis.craigslist.org/mis/1853516457.html" target="_blank">Craigslist&#8217;s Missed Connections</a>.

_&#8220;&#8230;thought you should know you turned a man on today.&#8221;_ 

This has got to just work wonders on the ladies. Â &#8220;I did?! That&#8217;s great! &#8230;so should I just go ahead and start blowing you right here in the store now?&#8221; &#8230;or something like that.

_&#8220;&#8230;you did nothing wrong, other than work out too much on them buns!&#8221;_

This one works really well because, you see, the women-folk aren&#8217;t as smart as us fellers. You gotsta reassure them and such. &#8220;Baby, you didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like &#8220;What? Why are you saying that?!&#8221; and that&#8217;s when you drop that hammer&#8230; &#8220;except work out too much on them buns!&#8221; Bam! Right then she&#8217;ll probably just yank that Walmart vest clean off and start pressin&#8217; her boobies up against you and such. True story! Happened to a friend of my cousin&#8217;s.

&#8230;if that don&#8217;t work, show them how shiny your truck wheels are.
