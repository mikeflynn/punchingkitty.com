You might have not realized it, but St. Louis is one of the world&#8217;s chess epicenters. No, we have no idea why since we watch baseball, but we&#8217;d guess it has something to do with all the time we spend inside here for reasons like: &#8220;It&#8217;s too cold!&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s too hot!&#8221; or &#8220;Someone&#8217;s shooting at me!&#8221; No matter the reason, St. Louis is a great place to play chess and because of that, the entire roster of the reigning collegiate chess championship team are all transferring from Texas Tech to Webster University.

> In an unprecedented move in the world of college competition, Texas Tech&#8217;s [entire team will transfer][1] to Webster University in the chess hotbed of St. Louis, home to the World Chess Hall of Fame. The private university promised more funding for the team and access to a new, 6,000-square-foot learning center in the city.
> 
> Unlike athletes who play college activities governed by the NCAA, chess players can transfer without sitting out for a year.

Of course the current Webster chess team has been banished from the school. Traded to St. Charles County Community College for a good student just dogging it for now while he finds himself to be named later.

> The team&#8217;s success drew numerous suitors from universities looking to improve their chess programs. When Webster offered full scholarships for all players, [Coach] Polgar was sold.

Huh. Maybe the NCAA should look in to this. Whole teams being led by their coach to transfer to a new school without penalty? Sure it might seem harsh to &#8220;<a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/04/webster_chess_team_annotated.jpg" target="_blank">already pretty bald guy</a>&#8221; (**1**), &#8220;<a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/04/webster_chess_team_annotated.jpg" target="_blank">dorky smile while not looking at the camera kid</a>&#8221; (**2**)  or &#8220;<a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/04/webster_chess_team_annotated.jpg" target="_blank">stoic little dude</a>&#8221; (**3**) to make them sit out for a whole year, but just seems weird that they can do something like this. Who will the Texas Tech football and basketball teams make help them with their &#8220;Beginner Algebra&#8221; homework now? Eh, who cares. If the basketball player can secretly get a car and all the tennis shoes he wants for being good at sports, these kids should get a free ride for being good at chess! Good for you guys! &#8230;plus no one can remember the last time anyone even glanced at a report card from a major sport athlete at a school like Texas Tech.

We&#8217;re happy for the new Webster chess team, but one note fellas: Don&#8217;t expect to see anything like this at Webster&#8230;

&#8230;so stare extra creepily at them in the quad while you have the chance.
