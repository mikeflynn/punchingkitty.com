A police officer tased a 12 year-old girl in the South County Mall&#8217;s Victoria&#8217;s Secret after coming in to arrest her mom for multiple unpaid traffic tickets.

> [Charlene Bratton] had just tried on some shorts and was about to buy them when she says a St. Louis County officer came looking for her. Bratton had warrants, she says, for numerous unresolved traffic tickets.
> 
> &#8220;He said, put your hands behind your back. I said for what. Next thing you know he tackled me down on the ground,&#8221; said Bratton.
> 
> [Bratton&#8217;s daughter Dejamon Baker] said, &#8220;I was just crying. I guess he got mad because I was crying or something, then he just took it out and just tased me.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I had fell on the floor and I couldn&#8217;t control myself I just kept on shaking and stuff,&#8221; said the girl.

Luckily she fell in to one of those giant boxes of panties they have there, so she&#8217;s ok outside of the taser wounds. The shaking actually caused her to sink to the bottom of the panty bin, which is where they put all the good stuff, so she ended up getting some great deals. Outside of her mom being in jail, and her getting tased in an underwear store, it was probably a pretty good day.

Naturally, the cop is claiming that the tasing was justified, but what exactly was the 12 year-old going to do to him? Maybe he was just _shocked_ to see a 12 year old shopping in Victoria&#8217;s Secret and wanted to make sure she felt the same&#8230;or maybe he only had a little bit of battery left in his taser and the 12 year-old was the only one he knew he could bring down. You decide!

Wait, don&#8217;t decide yet! You haven&#8217;t seen a reporter standing somewhat near the location hours after it happened. There&#8217;s no one to talk to, or anything to look at, but it totally adds a lot to the story, and the fact that someone can drive there lets you know it&#8217;s real!

&#8230;ok, now would it help if you saw some random shots of a police car? We have those too:<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Ok, great. Back to you Mike Bush, who is hopefully standing because that&#8217;s the new thing TV anchors do to make the news seem cool and edgy.
