Lafayette High School Senior Zach Frazer scored a perfect 36 on his ACT an achievement equaled by only 28 other students.  &#8230;28 lonely lonely other students.

> Frazer offered the following advice to students preparing for an upcoming test. “Stay focused, relax and don’t worry while taking the test.”

Though Frazer aced all of the those book-worm questions, I have one for you smart guy:  Describe third base.

Thought so.

Also, you could at least dress up a little for your school photo.
