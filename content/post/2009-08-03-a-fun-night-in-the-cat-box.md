> **cat box? &#8211; w4m &#8211; 22 (tulsa, ok)**
> 
> i was once in your cat box. it was tight, i could barely get my finger in, and i might have scratched you on the way out. i miss it. reply if this is you.

Wait.  Why would you ever want to put your finger in a cat box? &#8230;oh wait.  I don&#8217;t think we are talking about the same kind of &#8220;cat box.&#8221;

The hidden gem of this &#8220;Missed Connection&#8221; though?  The guy was pawing all over someone&#8217;s &#8220;cat box&#8221;, enough to possibly scratch them, but yet he&#8217;s searching for her contact information on Craigslist?

Unlike most &#8220;cat boxes,&#8221;  that one sounds pretty loose&#8230;but just like other &#8220;cat boxes&#8221; I&#8217;m guessing it smells pretty bad.
