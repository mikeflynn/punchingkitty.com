Now that shortstop Rafael Furcal has settled in with the Cardinals and his 2 year deal, he&#8217;s moving on from his previous digs in LA by <a href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/860-Greenridge-Dr_La-Canada-Flintridge_CA_91011_M16978-98326?mlslid=22162903" target="_blank">putting his house on the market for 3.8 Million</a>.

Shown above, &#8220;Casa de Furcal&#8221; is described as a &#8220;Grand Mediterranean Villa&#8221; with a &#8220;Dramatic gated two story entry with graceful curved grand staircase and travertine floors.&#8221; which sounds really nice, and possibly even nicer if we ever have someone explain to us what most of that meant.

Here&#8217;s a shot of the living room with the man himself on there so you can imagine him chilling in there looking at all the walls and lights and other fancy shit:

&#8230;and here&#8217;s the bedroom with a shot of Frucal picking his nose overlaid on top (which is exactly what bedrooms are for!):

Other rooms in the 7,402 square foot home include: A sunken living room, wet bar, giant walk-in closet, billard room, guest/maid quarters, gym, home theatre, sauna and wine cellar.

Sounds like a sweet place Rafael, but if you&#8217;re looking to purchase something here Pujols&#8217; place is available. We hear it has the best &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Sb0hGUNIQ" target="_blank">Scrooge McDuck-style Swimming Pool of Money</a>&#8221; room in the whole state! It&#8217;s the room right next to the in-house chapel. Don&#8217;t worry if you get confused, we&#8217;re pretty sure they prayed in both rooms.
