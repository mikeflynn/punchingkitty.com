Richard Mehan, a 19 year old Mizzou freshman from Chesterfield, is in the hospital after falling from his dorm&#8217;s balcony Saturday night. The St. Louis High School grad fell from a fifth-floor balcony to a fourth-floor Laws hall landing at 2 am and is in &#8220;fair&#8221; condition at a Columbia hospital.

What could he have been doing at 2am Missouri University Police captain Brain Weimer?

> Weimer said Mehan had been drinking.

Ah! Ok, so he got drunk and fell over the railing. &#8230;well, actually its far more stupid than that.

> Weimer said Mehan had been hanging onto the outside of a railing when his hands apparently slipped.

He was drunk, hanging on the outside of the railing. How can a plan that sounded so perfect go so wrong?$5 this guy&#8217;s a Missouri congressman in 20 years. Better yet, it sounds like he might have just hit his head hard enough to be the mayor of St. Louis.
