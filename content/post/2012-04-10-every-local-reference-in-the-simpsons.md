We might be a forgotten metro area to some, but not the Simpsons! The townsfolk of Springfield love to make St. Louis references and some guy on the internet has pulled all those references together in to one YouTube video&#8230;why? Because the internet is awesome!

One notable Simpsons St. Louis moment is when Cardinal slugger (and now hitting coach) Mark McGwire visited Sprinfield to cover up an MLB conspiracy by hitting homeruns and hiding documents under his large hat (pictured above). We can&#8217;t think of any others, but drop them in the comments if you can think of some.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XC3m3wID-MI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Some of it is pretty fake of course. Yeah, it&#8217;s just a cartoon, but you think East St. Louis would make a top 300 cities list? No way.
