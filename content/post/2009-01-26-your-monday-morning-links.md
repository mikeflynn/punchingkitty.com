Start off your week with some hot linking action!

There is no Bluebird, only Firebird: [STLToday.com&#8217;s Blender has the newly released schedule][1] for the re-lauched Firebird venue.

Michael Pinto at Fanboy.com describes a problem we here at PunchingKitty have seen for quite a while: [The Invasion of &#8220;Social Media Experts&#8221;][2]  If we may add some bitching to his great article: You dick (or boobs?) doesn&#8217;t get bigger just because you follow every retard that follows you!  Also&#8230;stop giving people &#8220;tips&#8221; on how to Twitter/Facebook/Whatever.  &#8230;we feel better already!

[Comments St. Louis has the sample ballot for the City&#8217;s March 3rd election][3].  Don&#8217;t vote for Denise Watson-Wesley Coleman for mayor because thats just way the hell too long to type out all the time.

[Cotton balls are scary.][4]

Still not sick of Obama inauguration stuff?  [Check out these photos then!][5]
