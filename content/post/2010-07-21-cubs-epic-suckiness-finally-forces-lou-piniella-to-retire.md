<a rel="attachment wp-att-5722" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/21/cubs-epic-suckiness-finally-forces-lou-piniella-to-retire/lou-piniella/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5722" title="lou-piniella" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/lou-piniella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="254" /></a>The Cubs are horrible even when they should be good, but managed to do what many teams haven&#8217;t been able to do: Take the fun out of the game for Lou Piniella, as &#8220;Sweet&#8221; Lou  announced that this season will be his last as a major league manager, retiring after 18 years as a player and 22 as a manager.

> &#8220;It&#8217;s been a wonderful experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way that I won&#8217;t cherish the memories here.&#8221;

There&#8217;s why they call him &#8220;Sweet&#8221;. He&#8217;s a liar though. Lou did the best he could in his tenure as Cubs manager, but jesus man: Milton Bradly, Carlos Zambrano, all the sucking&#8230;it _had_ to have been frustrating as hell for someone who was one hell of a player and a great manager for so long to put up with crap like that.

> &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of our accomplishments during my time here and this will be a perfect way for me to end my career,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But let me make one thing perfectly clear: Our work is far from over. I want to keep the momentum going more than anything else and win as many games as we can to get back in this pennant race.&#8221;

Translation: &#8220;It&#8217;s over. I mean it&#8217;s no &#8220;over&#8221;, but it&#8217;s over. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s over though, even if it is. It&#8217;s totally over though.&#8221;

We always loved Lou Piniella as a manager. Kicking stuff, throwing stuff, yelling at people. Guy was freaking great and we have to admit that when the Cubs hired him we were more than a little worried. If anyone had the balls to scream and kick the loser out of these under-achieving Cubs, it was Lou. Alas, eventually even the mighty Lou Piniella, childhood friend of our very own Tony LaRussa, was broken by the craptasticness that is the Cubs.
