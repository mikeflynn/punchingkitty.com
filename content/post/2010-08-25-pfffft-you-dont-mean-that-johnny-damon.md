That was former Kansas City Royal, Oakland Athletic, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankee and current Detroit Tiger <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3323" target="_blank"><strong>Johnny Damon</strong></a> ****yesterday after turning down a chance to be traded back to the Boston Red Sox team he helped bring a World Series Championship to in 2004 after sweeping the Car&#8230;ugh. Blockquote to break the painful memory anyone?

> The Red Sox claimed Damon on waivers this week, but he had the right to veto a move to Boston because of a no-trade clause in his contract.
> 
> &#8220;These guys really like me here,&#8221; Damon said Tuesday, adding that he spoke to each of his teammates individually to be sure he was wanted in the Tigers&#8217; clubhouse.

Jesus. Everyone knows you&#8217;re a liar and just don&#8217;t want to go back to Boston because the fans were mean to you while rocking pinstripes. Wanna know why? Because Detroit sucks dude. Totally sucks. As in &#8220;worse than St. Louis&#8221; sucks. When people visit Detroit they always step on their tip-toes like they are trying to quickly walk through a puddle. Going downtown has got to be like driving around in Grand Theft Auto but with less people on the street to hit.

> &#8220;I feel like we&#8217;re not out of it yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At least we can make some kind of run.&#8221;

No Johnny, Detroit is not going to make the playoffs.

> Damon said he&#8217;d like to play in Detroit next year too, but &#8220;there&#8217;s no guarantee.&#8221;

&#8230;that Deroit will even been there next year? First smart thing you&#8217;ve said all day. We hear their homeless are nearing completion on their Homeless Deathstar made out of shopping carts, old coats and used condoms. There&#8217;s one exhaust duct you can shoot to destroy it, but its all gross and you&#8217;d have to get up close. Just give them Detroit.
