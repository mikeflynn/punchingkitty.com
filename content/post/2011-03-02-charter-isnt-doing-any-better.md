[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9150" title="charter-communications" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/03/charter-communications.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="209" />][1]Everyone&#8217;s favorite former local internet monopoly Charter, posted a loss of $85 Million dollars last quarter, bringing their total loses for 2010 to a whopping $237 Million. All this, just a year after Charter filed for bankruptcy. Things are going just great according to Charter though, you see the secret is playing high school basketball games. There&#8217;s you&#8217;re big ticket TV right there.

Charter is banking on big gains from their commercial business, but it&#8217;s pretty damn clear what Charter needs to do to get back in the black: _Chalk Talk_ needs to get back on the air. **Randy Karraker**, **Tony Twist**, **McGraw Millhaven**&#8230;um&#8230;**the black guy**&#8230;all the great insight in to the local sports scene along with the added fun of spinning a wheel and distilling your insight in to a two or three words, poorly scribbled on a children&#8217;s learning to spell chalkboard. How can you not love that?! You&#8217;re in the hole for $237 Mil? _Chalk Talk_ alone is worth at least $146.oo. Sure you gotta subtract from that the price of chalk&#8230;and the cost of making a new wheel if you got rid of the last one&#8230;but whew, can you imagine the excitement when people mis-key the channel they actually wanted and end up on the Charter local channel to find _Chalk Talk_ where a bunch of out-of-work buddies make the standard &#8220;best fans in baseball&#8221; references between giggling about inside jokes? Hello windfall!

You&#8217;re welcome Charter.

Actually, try just throwing up the <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=indian+test+pattern&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&sa=X&ei=nd1tTdzBG4a0lQfd2oC-BA&ved=0CCYQsAQ&biw=1219&bih=836" target="_blank">Indian Test Pattern</a> too. Might be worth a shot.
