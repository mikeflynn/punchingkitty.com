A<a rel="attachment wp-att-4610" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/19/maybe-the-sound-isnt-dead-after-all/thesoundstl/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4610" title="thesoundstl" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/thesoundstl.png?filter=full" alt="" width="250" height="125" /></a>fter our recent post about the imminent demise of St. Louis radio station 100.3 The Sound, we have been getting tips that maybe&#8230;just maybe&#8230;The Sound might be making a go of it.

We&#8217;re not saying they still aren&#8217;t dead, but we&#8217;ve heard that are actually trying to hire people, which has got to be a weird feeling over at ClearChannel.

&#8220;Wait, how do we fire someone if they don&#8217;t work here yet?&#8221;

&#8220;No. We&#8217;re hiring them.&#8221;

&#8220;So when do I take their stuff?&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t. We bring in new stuff.&#8221;

&#8220;Where should I put it?&#8221;

&#8220;Does it matter? The place is a ghost town&#8230;put them over by the skeleton of our last salesman.&#8221;

&#8220;Ok, and then you are going to bring them in and tell them how valuable they were to the company before kicking them out the door?&#8221;

&#8220;No, that will happen in about a month.&#8221;
