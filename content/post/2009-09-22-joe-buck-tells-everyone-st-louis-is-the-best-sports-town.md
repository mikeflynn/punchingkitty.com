In Joe Bucks new (?) &#8220;Buck Shot&#8221; online web short series, Buck, after his totally flat &#8220;I&#8217;m a national sports guy&#8221; world series winner call in 2006, has finally come out in favor of St. Louis on a national level!

Buck and his crew interview many St. Louis personalities, including not one, but two free 101 ESPN commercials for his friends over there (Read: Randy K.).
