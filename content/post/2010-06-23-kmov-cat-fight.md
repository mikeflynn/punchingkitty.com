<a href="http://stlmediastuff.blogspot.com/2010/06/contratemps-at-kmov4.html" target="_blank">STLMediaÂ is passing on a rumor</a> from their anonymous tip line that KMOV she-anchors Vickie Newton and Jasmine Huda are involved in a brewing mess that one can only hope ends up in a Dynasty-level brawl with a 40% clothes-ripping-off-and-a-boob-popping-out chance.

Says the STLMedia source:

> Jasmine Huda to anchor the 6 at KMOV, Vicki Newton is furious and had a fit in the middle of the newsroom. The tension between the two has been fun to watch.

&#8230;and that&#8217;s when Larry Conners makes his move pushing in that baby pool filled with chocolate pudding. They said &#8220;Larry, why do you always have so much chocolate pudding mix in your office?&#8221;, &#8220;When are you ever going to eat that pudding Larry?&#8221;, &#8220;Come on Larry, take that inflatable baby pool home. You got that thing like 10 years ago.&#8221; but they were all fools&#8230;fools! Larry Conners: 1, Everyone Else: 0
