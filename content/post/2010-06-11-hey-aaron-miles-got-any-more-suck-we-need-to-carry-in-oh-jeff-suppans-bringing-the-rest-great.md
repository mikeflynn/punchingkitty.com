Oh yeah, Jeff Suppan, we remember him. The guy that Fox Sports Midwest dated exclusively for the three years he was here last. Every stupid little piece before the games was either about Jeff Suppan or included Jeff Suppan as we followed him go do something hilarious, like doing a regular person&#8217;s job. _Oh man, you&#8217;re a pitcher, you shouldn&#8217;t be working at Target! Hilarious!_

So how&#8217;s old &#8220;Soup&#8221; been doing?

> Suppan signed with the Brewers as a free agent in December of 2006. He was 29-36 with a 5.08 ERA in Milwaukee.

Horrible. He&#8217;s been horrible. Here&#8217;s how <a href="http://www.brewcrewball.com/2010/6/8/1506801/goodbye-jeff-suppan" target="_blank">the Brewers faithful</a> reflected on Jeff after his release:

> Jeff Suppan seems to be a very good person and teammate. He was a positive influence in the Milwaukee community in his 3 and a half years as a Brewer. I wish him success in whatever he decides to do in the future.

> Unfortunately, he is not a good pitcher, and was not really a very good pitcher at any point in his career.
> 
> Jeff, it&#8217;s been an interesting ride but it&#8217;s time to move on. Good luck in any future endeavors. Next year the Brewers will not be cutting you a check, and that $15 million can be put towards building a more competitive team.

Doesn&#8217;t matter. Tony likes him. He&#8217;s old. It&#8217;s all you need. Get him in here, and get him a dose of that Dave Duncan magic and lets seem him limp along until we all show up at Busch Stadium with pitchforks and torches. They&#8217;ll tell Suppan to fake an injury and he&#8217;ll be gone. This is going to be so great!

Now&#8230;does anyone have Preston Wilson&#8217;s number?
