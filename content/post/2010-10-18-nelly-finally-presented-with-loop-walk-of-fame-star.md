Apparently this star was really important to him, but not enough to take 5 minutes to shake Look Godfather Joe Edwards&#8217; hand sometime during the last _four years_. This all seems pretty stupid to make a big deal about his &#8220;induction&#8221; in to the Walk of Fame now, but we&#8217;ll concede that he did eventually give a crap enough to make an appearance for his hometown fans at some point and&#8230;what?!

Of _course_ he was an hour late to the induction he himself scheduled. Why not at this point?

> Nearly an hour past the scheduled 4:30 p.m. start time, Nelly and a crew that included his long-time bodyguard walked down Delmar Boulevard to the podium on the sidewalk in front of Blueberry Hill, just behind his star.
> 
> &#8220;I never thought this was possible,&#8221; he said amid screams from the crowd.

One would think it seemed a little more possible sometime over the last four years.

Following the outside dedication cerimony, Nelly was joined by the St. Lunatics Murphy Lee, Kyjuan, Ali, and everyone&#8217;s favorite, City Spud to preform an hour-long show in Blueberry Hill&#8217;s Duck Room venue.

In a somewhat related, not really, but sorta related, story a day later, Nelly Furtado showed up on time to her brand new star being added to Canda&#8217;s Walk of Fame. How nice of her! We&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s busy, has things to do, but she made it work for her native land. How polite of _herrrr_.
