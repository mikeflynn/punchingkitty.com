Yes, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/the-worst-music-video-ever-was-shot-in-a-st-louis-condos-kitchen/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve made fun of him</a>, and then <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/02/11/10-questions-for-local-rapper-corle-2-da/" target="_blank">interviewed him</a>, and now we&#8217;re promoting his new video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fn0LEDu4Rw" target="_blank">&#8220;Facebook Jump Off&#8221;</a>&#8230;because he put a screenshot of us in there. Yes, even the venerable Punching Kitty has moments of whorish behavior. Whorish mind you. We aren&#8217;t whores, but sometimes we may assume the characteristics of a whore. Ladies, you know what we&#8217;re getting at right?

Anyway, local rapper **Corle 2 Da** dropped us a line to let us know that we made the cut and have a quick cameo in his latest video (see animated gif version below, and the full version is [after the jump][1]).

When we not so subtly suggested that we appear in one of his famed YouTube videos during the interview it appeared our chances were slim at best.

> **PK:** You’ve given visual shoutouts to the RFT in both “So St. Louis” and “Digital” is this interview our first step in getting a Punching Kitty appearance?
> 
> **Corle**: Ah a Punching Kitty appearance…in an upcoming video I’m guessing, well it is definitely a possibility, the RFT has been real supportive of my work and I appreciate that.  I saw you won an award at RFT web awards as well didn’t you?  Really though, they are great at recognizing people and topics in the community.

&#8230;yet here we sit, watching an animated gif go back and forth! In turn for this, we will guarantee the following things for Corle 2 Da as a thank you.

1,000 video views. (To keep things simple on the accounting side, we&#8217;ll just take credit for the first 1,000.)
