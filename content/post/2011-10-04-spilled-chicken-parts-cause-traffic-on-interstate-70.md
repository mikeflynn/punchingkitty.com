If this sounds familiar, it&#8217;s probably because a different truck driver did the same thing to your mother last night.

The cargo was described as vaguely as &#8220;chicken parts&#8221;. Chicken parts that we&#8217;re assuming were scraped in to a pile on the road, with each one individually blown on while being held with two fingers&#8230;and then thrown back in to the truck. 5 hour rule dude. You&#8217;re not going to taste it after a few dunks in that think BBQ sauce packet anyway.

KMOX described the situation thusly&#8230;

> For most of the evening motorists, East bound on I-70  in North St. Louis had to deal with what may go down as a once in a lifetime event.

Well hold on there skippy. This is hardly a &#8220;once in a lifetime event&#8221;. Not for this state. Not in this year.

As you can see there at the end, we were pretty sure Missouri&#8217;s truck drivers were making a giant highway sandwich with the mayo, onions and meat&#8230;but &#8220;chicken parts&#8221;?! Now we&#8217;re not so sure. However, we are sure that spilling food or a food like substance in on a Missouri highway or interstate is far from a rare thing this year. Hell, we still have 3 months to go! Lots of time left for some ranch dressing or Easy Cheese spillage to put the finishing touch on this meal.

If anyone has some good recipes that use these ingredients, send them our way!
