Yesterday we brought you the absurd tale of one **Laura Coppinger**, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/11/16/the-st-charles-sugar-plum-fairy-is-a-dirty-girl-and-got-fired/" target="_blank">the once Sugar Plum Fairy in the St. Charles annual Christmas pageant that was fired on grounds that she cussed at a standard city employee drug screening</a>. Cussing, apparently even while not in character, is a big no-no for St. Charles&#8217; Christmas staff as stated in the sounds fake, but apparently all too real, “Christmas Traditions Code of Conduct”. Obviously this is absurd! It&#8217;s one thing to be fired over cussing while in costume surrounded by kids, but it&#8217;s quite another story if you are out and about looking very un fairy-like and decide to cuss on your own free time. But while St. Charles is clearly a city with a large stick up their ass, we&#8217;re now wondering: Was she really dimed out and fired for spontaneous cussing away from work, or was it because her other performing gigs involve a little less costume and a lot more skin?

We recently were made aware that Laura Coppinger, former Sugar Plum Fairy, also performs burlesque under the name &#8220;**Mimi le Yu**&#8220;.

&#8220;Research&#8221; and &#8220;fact checking&#8221; are crap we let the real news people do, leaving us more time to do things that we&#8217;re good at like obscure reference dick jokes and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/punchingkitty/posts/10150354500366436" target="_blank">pissing people off</a>, but rarely does research involve burlesque, so lets do this thing! &#8230;so we need like a oversized magnifying glass now or what?

[Mentally create and watch us in a research montage&#8230;now!]

[&#8230;ok now fade the montage out to black&#8230;perfect. Now continue reading.]

It didn&#8217;t take long to lock down the fact that &#8220;Mimi le Yu&#8221; is definitely the name of an active burlesque dancer and her photos to have a strong resemblance to the photos that have been included in the recent &#8220;Sugar Plum Fairy&#8221; news (note the teeth).

&#8230;oh and there&#8217;s this MySpace post with a captions of both her real name, and her burlesque name:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11115" title="coppinger_mimileyu_myspace" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/11/coppinger_mimileyu_myspace.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="434" />][2]

So ok, the research wasn&#8217;t that hard. **Laura Coppinger aka the nationally known Sugar Plum Fairy, is also burlesque dancer Mimi le Yu!** But is that why St. Charles city let her go from her long-time post as the Sugar Plum Fairy? If so, is the cussing a cover-up? Why not tell Coppinger the &#8220;real&#8221; reason then, as it&#8217;s pretty clear she&#8217;s under the impression she was fired for off-duty cussing? Maybe the city used the cussing as the one clear rule violation as a way to get her out the door without having to dive in to the whole naughty details? No one knows for sure since St. Charles sure isn&#8217;t talking so far.

To be clear, we&#8217;re not saying she should have been fired for being a burlesque dancer, or for cussing at herself on her own time. She seems like a cool chick, a great Sugar Plum Fairy, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jngCmM0cfKo" target="_blank">looks to put on a hell of a burlesque show</a>. We&#8217;re just wondering why we hadn&#8217;t heard this connection being made anywhere else. If St. Charles will shit-can Christmas characters for saying &#8220;shit-can&#8221;, you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d really be against this:

We think that&#8217;s just super&#8230;but you gotta think St. Charles city officials don&#8217;t really agree with us too often. We can probably all agree on pudding though. Everyone loves pudding.
