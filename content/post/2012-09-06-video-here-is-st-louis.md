The folks from <a href="http://anatasisfilms.com" target="_blank">Anastasis Films</a> but together this great little video about the best of St. Louis. It&#8217;s very well done and a good change of pace from the various stabbings and shootings that usually dominate everything on a daily basis.

> Out of our love and passion for St. Louis City, we wanted to showcase some of the places and people that make it great. With special music from Band Called Catch (<a href="http://www.bandcalledcatch.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bandcalledcatch.com</a>).

_**Update:** Various hat tips to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/zevwc/here_is_st_louis/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, everyone on Facebook, everyone in the real world&#8230;so ok, it would seem we were the last people in St. Louis to find this on Vimeo. Whatever._
