That&#8217;s Tony LaRussa talking last week about the rally in the nations capitol over the weekend put on by Glenn Beck and featuring Sarah Palin. Political? Maybe, maybe not. Controversial? No doubt about it. Beck&#8217;s rally has both ruffled feathers and drawn curious looks for its choice of date and guests, despite Beck&#8217;s claims that the point is only to restore the honor of stuff that most believe still had plenty of honor in the tank, and is saying any date-correlations are completely accidental (the day the rally takes place is the anniversary of Martin Luther King&#8217;s &#8220;I Have A Dream&#8221; speech). To this point, we heard that Pujols was ready to back out of the appearance, up until the last second, if it turned at all political.

Boooorrringgg! Did Pujols hit some dingers in to the reflecting pool or not?!

> Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols says he&#8217;s honored and humbled after receiving an award for his off-field charitable work during Glenn Beck&#8217;s rally at the Lincoln Memorial.
> 
> Pujols says he thanks God for giving him a platform through a high-profile career &#8212; and says that allows him to be more than just being a player.

After Pujols&#8217; speech with his nondescript medal (as you can see above), Beck, in a shocking move, took to his famous chalkboard to illustrate the problems with this year&#8217;s Cardinals team.
