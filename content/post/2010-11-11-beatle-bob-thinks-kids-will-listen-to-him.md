St. Louis&#8217; **Beatle Bob**, the uber fan of all shows (and fan of this very site) who has been to a show every night since Jesus was like 26 or something has a new project that doesn&#8217;t involve kicking people in the shins with his flailing dance moves.

Bob is included on a children&#8217;s album about eating healthy. &#8220;Healthy Food for Thought: Good Enough to Eat,&#8221; which is apparently not at all a joke, is a double-CD with songs about nutrition andÂ exercise.

> &#8220;It&#8217;s great to be a part of it, and it has some of my favorite recording artists,&#8221; said Beatle Bob, 57, who lives in Overland and is known to family as Bob Matonis.

We&#8217;ve talked with Beatle Bob and though he&#8217;s a nice guy, we are a little stumped about what he could be contributing to the project. Hair, clothes and Michael J Fox-style dance moves generally don&#8217;t translate well over an audio recording.

> He can&#8217;t sing, but he&#8217;s listened to enough music lyrics that coming up with a rhyme came easy, said Beatle Bob, who has been a vegetarian for 28 years. He wrote and recorded &#8220;Down at Big Greens,&#8221; about a vegan eatery, where eating healthy is not only delicious, it&#8217;s hip.
> 
> &#8220;I was maybe remembering my teen-age days and having to hang out at hamburger places,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Let&#8217;s think of a place that&#8217;s a cool hang-out for kids that&#8217;s healthier.'&#8221;

Wow. This is not going to work at all. Also worth pointing out is that &#8220;Down at Big Green&#8217;s&#8221; is the name of the porno version of Marvel&#8217;s Hulk movie franchise.

Good luck with the new project Bob! It&#8217;s sure to be a big hit&#8230;oh wait, it came out in August. So, there&#8217;s that.
