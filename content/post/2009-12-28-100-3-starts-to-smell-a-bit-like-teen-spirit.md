Says the tipster&#8230;

> CONFIRMED. GEN X RADIO COMES TO 100.3. MUSIC OF THE 90&#8217;S AND 80&#8217;S AIMED AT GEN X. EXPECT STUNTING AND A LAUNCH RIGHT AFTER FIRST OF THE YEAR. THE ARCH IS SCREWED.

We love this idea.  The only time we listen to the radio these days is when the Point is doing one of their &#8220;Wayback Weekends&#8221; full of 90s music, so if 100.3 wants to make a whole station out of that idea, we can&#8217;t wait.

I mean we still aren&#8217;t really going to listen to much radio&#8230;but if we forget our iPod, this station finally sounds like a decent music alternative.

&#8212;-

Actually, it didn&#8217;t take much digging to confirm the tipster.  It will be called The Sound, here&#8217;s their site, <a href="http://www.soundstl.com/main.html" target="_blank">soundstl.com</a>, which is un-shockingly horrible.

Also, to add a little bit of radio intrigue to this news it appears former head honcho of Bonneville stations 106.5 The Arch and 101.1 Movin, Jules Riley is returning to town to take on her former mates as the new PD of The Sound and possibly z107.7!

Its little secret that Jules was against the move that made 101.1 from dance music (Movin) to sports (101 ESPN) and left soon after loosing control of that frequency.  Now she is apparently back and in control of more or less the same two properties with The Sound going right after the Arch and z107.7 a more modern, and more popular, version of Movin, only with the more unstable ClearChannel.

If you give a rat&#8217;s ass about radio, this could get interesting.

If you don&#8217;t, then it won&#8217;t get any more interesting than this.  Fair warning.
