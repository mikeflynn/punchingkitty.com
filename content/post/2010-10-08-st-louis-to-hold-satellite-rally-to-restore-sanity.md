<a href="http://www.rallytorestoresanity.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Show host John Stewart&#8217;s rally</a> to combat the [<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7244" title="STL_RallyPoster_Web" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/STL_RallyPoster_Web.gif" alt="" width="175" height="292" />][1]rising insanity on either side of the political bickering has a lot of people heading to Washington D.C. October 30th to witness an event so sane and even-keled, it will make you say &#8220;Hmm. Interesting. I&#8217;m going to think about that and get back to you with a well-thought out response.&#8221;

> Because we’re looking for those people. We’re looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn’t be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it’s appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler. Or Charlie Chaplin in certain roles.

But you can&#8217;t make it to Washington D.C.! You have to get drunk at a Halloween party and check to see if that chick from work dressed up like a sexy kitty or sexy nurse or sexy lunch lady! Dude. Weak.

That&#8217;s cool, a bunch of other people that want to do something about all the sanity, but don&#8217;t want to leave their zipcode are getting together to pretend they care enough to drive to Washington D.C.:

> This is the St. Louis satellite rally for The Daily Show&#8217;s Rally to Restore Sanity in Washington D.C. Because a lot of us in the Midwest have s**t to do here and can&#8217;t make it.

For reals! They have a permit, and are lining up entertainment while roughly 200 people have confirmed attendance on Facebook. People are pretty excited about this rally for a rally!

Whooo!

Hell yeah&#8230;well&#8230;ok&#8230;so maybe do some research and then&#8230;rally! Yeah dude!

&#8230;.Ok, look. Really don&#8217;t think you need to comment that you have &#8220;other obligations&#8221; you could just not say anything for instance.  Just seems weird to drop this. Ok whatever, more rally rally for us!

As for us? We&#8217;re planning on getting down there to rally for the rally with the rest of you. Not Erin though. We hear he&#8217;s busy.
