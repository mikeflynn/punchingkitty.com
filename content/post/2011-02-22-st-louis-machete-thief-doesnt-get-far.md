The plan was perfect. Right at midnight, grab the machete, run in to the 7-Eleven, get the cash and jump back in the van. The machete was a really nice touch and will allow a lot of other sites to use stills from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/" target="_blank">that movie of the same name</a> as all-too-obvious graphic, but too bad the clerk saw your get away vehicle!

> [T]he clerk saw him get into a large white van, which drove away, police said. Officers spotted the vehicle a short time later, arrested two men and found a machete inside the van.

You know your attempt at crime sucks when the story on KSDK&#8217;s header graphic is taller than the full description of your lame step towards criminal mastery.
