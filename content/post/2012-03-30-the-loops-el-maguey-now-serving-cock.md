You spend your lunch hour on this lovely Friday afternoon at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-maguey-st-louis" target="_blank">a local Mexican establishment</a> and everything was pretty nice&#8230;except for the bill.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13225" title="el_maguey_cock" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2012/03/el_maguey_cock.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" />][1]

Good thing we won&#8217;t be expensing this meal, or we&#8217;d probably have some explaining to do.

We really don&#8217;t remember ordering that, and even if we accidentally ordered it by saying the Spanish word for it we definitely would have sent it back. We hate to be the guy to send things back to the kitchen because you look like such a douche, but &#8220;cock&#8221;, even for only $2, is where we draw the line.
