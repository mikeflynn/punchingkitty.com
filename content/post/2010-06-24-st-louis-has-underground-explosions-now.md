Add it to the list of things St. Louis gets: Underground explosions.

Around 5p Wednesday evening, City Hall was shaken by an underground explosion, which they said it was a blown transformer&#8230;no, not the cool kind of Transformer, but the boring kind that AmerenUE breaks every winter and summer&#8230;and fall&#8230;and spring.

Government excuses bullshit.

Our guess?

That&#8217;s were we buried former Cardinal Ray King after we &#8220;traded&#8221; him a while back. Turns out he was just sleeping and he&#8217;s pissed. This is gonna be just like _Cloverfield_, but it will be sweatier and with more walks.
