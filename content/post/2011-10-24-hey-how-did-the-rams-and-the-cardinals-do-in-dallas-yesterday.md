Not well. Not. Well.

The Cardinals were taken to school by a guy who&#8217;s playoff beard looks a hell of a lot like the lip fur our old 3rd grade bus driver, Bertha rocked, and the Rams just continued to suck at their usual level.

At least the Rams are consistent, and have been all year right? That&#8217;s something. That&#8217;s important enough for a reward!

Awww&#8230;that&#8217;s nice. Former Pittsburg head coach, and Super Bowl winner, Bill Cowher, thoughts?

  Despite the loss, the Cardinals seem to be in better shape with Chris Carpenter going tomorrow&#8230;and if you&#8217;re searching for that silver lining, well at least if/when the Cardinals win the World Series, they&#8217;re assured to win it at home now.
