St. Louis Craigslist, you never stop dropping little joy pellets. Little tiny joy turds, and just like turds, they are something to occasionally gawk and marvel at, but that&#8217;s about as close as you&#8217;re willing to get.

Take the recent example of someone giving away their bathroom trash. Let that sink in for a second. Now take another second to let the fact that this _free_ bathroom trash they are _giving away_, is priced at $150.

  We couldn&#8217;t resist and emailed the guy with a few questions:
</p>

> We saw your &#8220;free bathroom trash&#8221; ad on Craigslist, and we&#8217;re intrigued. What&#8217;s the run down? Is there a strong demand for your trash so far? You don&#8217;t wipe your ass with 20 dollar bills do you? What&#8217;s the $150 for if it&#8217;s free?
> 
> Any chance you sit in a pile of it and touch yourself? That doesn&#8217;t make us more or less interested, but it just seemed plausible and figured we&#8217;d ask.
> 
> Thanks!
> 
> P.S. Please don&#8217;t add us to your serial killer list probably written in lipstick. We&#8217;re good people, just asking a few questions. No harm. Great shirt today! Is that new?
