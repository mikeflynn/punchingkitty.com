It&#8217;s ok, I couldn&#8217;t remember what a Blockbuster was either.  Thank god for wikipedia right?

Anyway, if you are either a 15 year old girl or a guy with a big, window-less van and a creepy mustache, you should totally head over to the Blockbuster Video in Creve Coeur at 11600 Olive Blvd tomorrow at 6p because there&#8217;s going to be  a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=194292416277&index=1" target="_blank">New Moon party</a> and we hear its going to be one of the biggest crowds in recent years at a Blockbuster.  We&#8217;re talking 10 maybe 12 people.  Crrraaaazzzzyyy!

Also, if you are one of the first 125 people through the door, you get a free pass to the New Moon  screening on November 19th!  Which now that I dropped that joke above about only 12 people going, someone looks like an ass don&#8217;t they?  Not sure if its me for being a dick or them for over estimating the number of people that can actually find the willpower to go to a Blockbuster though.  You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d go up and just delete that joke, but thats not how I roll.  Stream of consciousness baby!

Now the dilemma begins in the heads of the PR people of St. Louis&#8230;

> &#8220;Well, he _did_ mention it, but he also killed it because no one goes to Blockbusters.&#8221;

> &#8220;I mean he&#8217;s right though.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;We&#8217;ll yeah he&#8217;s right, but still.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Do we send him more of these?&#8221;

> &#8220;Is all press really good press?!&#8221;

You also might be wondering &#8220;Why is there a picture of Kristen Bell at the top of this post?&#8221;

Because that chick in New Moon is unattractive.

There you go, simple answer.
