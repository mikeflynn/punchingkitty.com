Arnold police are still looking for the bank robber who exclaimed &#8220;Go Cards!&#8221; on his way out the door with the cash. Welcome to St. Louis. This is what we do: break laws and watch baseball.

> Police say the man entered the First Bank at 3850 Jeffco Boulevard, approached the teller and presented a note demanding money around 1:15 p.m. Friday.
> 
> After taking an undisclosed amount of money, the man reportedly yelled, &#8220;Go Cards!&#8221; and left the bank.
> 
> Police describe the suspect as a 5&#8217;7&#8243; white male in his late 30s wearing glasses, a full beard and a dark blazer over a black top.

Not wearing red during your bank heist?! Some fan you are. He&#8217;s probably one of these &#8220;huge fan only when the Cardinals get in the playoffs&#8221; guys. The same horrible people that when a real fan is rightfully mother-f*cking the Cardinals for their poor managerial decision, or because they can&#8217;t get a freaking hit in 5 innings, they get on Twitter and tell everyone what horrible fans they are for not &#8220;#believing&#8221; or for getting upset (examples: <a href="https://twitter.com/_ShelbyJean_/statuses/260188344573652992" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/QisWhite56/statuses/260178721330327552" target="_blank">2</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MolinaFan4/statuses/260171186351243264" target="_blank">3</a>). If you are one of these people&#8230;people who couldn&#8217;t name the Cardinals starting rotation, but want to tell others that &#8220;True Cardinal fans don&#8217;t get mad at the team!&#8221;&#8230;please go die in a fire with a cherished loved one watching. It&#8217;s easy to &#8220;believe&#8221; when you really don&#8217;t care if the Cardinals lose. If they lose and you say &#8220;Oh well.&#8221; and then turn the TV off and immediately resume your sports are dumb hipster mentality rather than smashing whatever is closest to you and go in to a rage coma, we&#8217;re talking about you. You suck. Just watch the games quietly.

As for you bank robber, we actually aren&#8217;t sure what type of fan you are. Please write your response on the back of a few hundred dollar bills (one bill per word please) and drop them off at Punching Kitty HQ. Thanks!
