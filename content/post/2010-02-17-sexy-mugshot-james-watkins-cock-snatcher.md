> According to Captain Brad Wells, Chief of Detectives for the Madison County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, deputies were called to the 3300 V.F.W. Lane around 7:50 a.m. Saturday in response to a reported disturbance. When they arrived at the home of James T. Watkins, deputies noticed blood and feathers in the living room.
> 
> The deputies were given permission to search the property and found a dead rooster in a trash can outside the home. A live rooster was found hiding in a bush on Watkins&#8217; property.

&#8220;Oh crap the cops!&#8221;

&#8220;Rooster that just won, you hide in the bushes&#8230;.and I&#8217;ll just put this dead rooster in the trash. Â It&#8217;s the perfect crime!&#8221;

The roosters were stolen from a neighbor who valued the roosters as $250 a piece, which he later was totally pissed at himself about for not making up a higher price.
