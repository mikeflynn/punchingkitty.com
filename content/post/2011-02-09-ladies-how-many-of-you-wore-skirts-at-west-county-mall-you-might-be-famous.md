For one, he&#8217;s worked really hard on making himself look like the serial killer in a bad action movie&#8230;and also because he rigged up a hidden camera and good upskirt videos of ladies at West County Mall.

Congratulations! Some of you West County ladies are now famous! Not &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; famous, more like &#8220;I have that same pair of underwear&#8230;oh crap!&#8221; famous.

Police charged the 51 year old man with second-degree invasion of privacy for that acts that are alleged to have happened on September 4th.

We&#8217;d recommend losing the bald mullett thing to Danny before his courtÂ appearance. Main reason: You can&#8217;t do that look and not come off like a rapist. The rule of thumb, no matter how unfair it may seem, is that baldness is about actual skull coverage, not the average length of hair on your head. Oh you pulled your long hair in to a ponytail? Nope, doesn&#8217;t matter. Also, lets just go ahead and kill the myth that putting your creepy guy long hair in to a ponytail like a 13 year old girl counts as &#8220;formal&#8221;. It does not.
