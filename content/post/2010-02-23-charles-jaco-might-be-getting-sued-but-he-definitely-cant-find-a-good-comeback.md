</p>

We do however have proof that Chuck ain&#8217;t one for the comebacks.  STLMedia via <a href="http://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SharpElbows.net</a> posted a recent video recorded by someone at a Tea Party rally trying to get a rise out of Jaco.

Jaco didn&#8217;t fare well.  Actually neither side did.

After being pushed by the uploader to say what the term &#8220;tea bagging&#8221; meant, Jaco just repeated &#8220;Well do you know what it is?&#8221;  Zing!  Jaco 1, other guy 0.  Then the video gets boring as the video guy and Jaco partake in a verbal slap fight, neither one of them coming out looking all that smart or witty.

Here&#8217;s the end result&#8230;

Jaco comes off looking mean, and frankly, very unbecoming of a reporter who is supposed to be objective while reporting the news.  None of this is a surprise mind you <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/charles-jaco/" target="_blank">given our history with him</a>.

The camera holder, doesn&#8217;t come off looking well either.  He comes off looking desperate in trying to bait Jaco and then overreacting when he was &#8220;bumped&#8221; by the Fox 2 reporter.  This may surprise you, especially Jaco, but if he is getting charges for the &#8220;bumping&#8221; in this video, then that&#8217;s a farce.  Jaco shouldn&#8217;t have done it, but we don&#8217;t agree with charges on something as stupid as that.

Wait.  What&#8217;s that?  Oh, I&#8217;m already bored with this story.
