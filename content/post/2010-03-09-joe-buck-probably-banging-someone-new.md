&#8230;technically the word is that he is &#8220;taking a break&#8221; from his wife&#8230;but come on dudes.  We all know what that means.

Jerry Burger took a break from talking about people no one gives a damn about and <a href="http://bergersbeat.com/wp-content/themes/berger1/images/Header.jpg" target="_blank">posing for photos</a> like one of those 6 year old beauty pageant girls to <a href="http://bergersbeat.com/joe-buck-wife-separated/" target="_blank">actually break a story</a>:

> Sports broadcaster  **Joe Buck**, 42, and his wife,  **Ann**,  are separated “They’re taking a break,” said Joe’s mom, **Carol Buck**.  Buck, the son of the late legendary sportscaster Jack Buck, helms “Joe Buck Live” on HBO and continues his chores on FOX.

As far as &#8220;other women&#8221;, selection at Fox Sports ranging from the rough-looking <a href="http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/5817392.jpg" target="_blank">Jeanie Zlasko</a> to&#8230;well all kinds of decent tail.  Which of course there is a blog all about! Sideline Hotties has a whole section for <a href="http://www.sidelinehotties.com/category/foxsports-babes/" target="_blank">the women of Fox Sports</a>!

Enjoy.  That goes double for you Joe.  You dog!

[_Editor&#8217;s Note: This post was pretty much all made up because we don&#8217;t know much more than Burger does. If you have_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>any</em></span> _info to share on this, hit us up on tips@punchingkitty.com!_]

**Update:** 

We missed <a href="http://deadspin.com/5488160/joe-buck-wife-decide-to-spend-a-little-quality-time-apart" target="_blank">Deadspin&#8217;s take on this</a> yesterday that had this little nugget:

> On March 1st we received a tip from a friend of the family who said something similar but we spoke to [The Agency][1] last week, which represents Buck, and they denied any separation and said Joe and Ann are &#8220;not even close&#8221; to getting a divorce. So maybe Buck&#8217;s mother is a little confused.

We&#8217;re thinking she&#8217;s not confused, but maybe was not counting on Jerry Burger figuring out his computer.
