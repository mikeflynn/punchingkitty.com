In what is no doubt the most anyone has ever talked about radio since&#8230;um&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;jesus radio metaphors are hard&#8230;probably because no one cares about radio. Except for the St. Louis sports media who still thinks its really really really really really important.

> As first reported today on STLtoday.com, the team announced late this afternoon that it will return its radio broadcasts to KMOX next season after five years at KTRS, where they had been airing after a 51-year run at KMOX.

The Cardinals choose **KMOX** over the other options of staying at **KTRS** and moving to sports talk upstart **WXOS**, 101.1 FM saying &#8220;fan sentiment and feedback&#8221; was a major factor in the decision. Some would say they choose wrong, that AM radio, despite KMOX&#8217;s legendary signal, is somehow more dead than FM radio. True, but our initial guess is that the Cardinals asked that very question and KMOX&#8217;s owner CBS Radio had answer.

Our initial guess seems to be lining up with the rumors we have heard after talking to a few people after the news broke. Our guess? CBS promised the Cardinals that they too would be on the more robust FM signal soon. How? By **killing KEZK and moving KMOX to 102.5 FM**, leaving 112o AM to be a more sports-heavy talk sister station to KMOX, and of course, simulcast Cardinal games on both signals.

With that information in hand, the Cardinals had the perfect answer. Going to KMOX certainly wins by the old-folks crowd, and the move to FM nullifies any benefits that WOXS was offering. No brainer.

&#8230;you know what would be super cool though, is if someone could invent a device that also broadcasts video of the game along with the audio. That would really be something! You wouldn&#8217;t want Mike Shannon on there though, he gets a little sloppy. You&#8217;d want someone smooth, well spoken, but knows when to shut up and, of course, above reproach&#8230;eh, screw it. This guy will do:
