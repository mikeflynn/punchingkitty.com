Oh look the RFT&#8217;s Music blog has an interview with some local rapper named &#8220;Corle 2 Da&#8221;&#8230;why does that name sound familiar?&#8230;

> ​You may have seen this excellent vid floating around the Interwebz in the past two weeks. &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; is the work of one **Corle 2 Da**, a Belleville rapper looking to make his mark on this side of the river.

Belleville rapper&#8230;god this all sound so familiar. Wait! &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221;!? As in <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/the-worst-music-video-ever-was-shot-in-a-st-louis-condos-kitchen/" target="_blank">making it rain with singles &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221;</a>?

No. This is the &#8220;excellent vid floating around the Interwebz&#8221;?! Jokes! Gotta be a joke.

> &#8220;A lot of people call it the new St. Louis anthem,&#8221; says Corle&#8217;s manager Ron Boles, with Red River Entertainment. &#8220;We really are happy with it. We&#8217;re gonna put the video in Vintage Vinyl where people can buy it.&#8221;
> 
> The 30-year-old started rapping with friends at age 12. Though he was born in Alton and currently resides in Belleville, Corle considers himself a dyed-in-the-wool, Provel-eating, Cards cheering, Rams-lamenting St. Louisian.

What?! Seriously?! You&#8217;re interviewing him now? For reals?

> &#8220;The whole area around here thrives off of St. Louis,&#8221; Corle says.

What the hell does that even mean?! It _is_ St. Louis. We live _in_ St. Louis. You can&#8217;t thrive off yourself. That would create a thrive loop and would probably lead to&#8230;crappy rap videos! Ah, it&#8217;s all so clear now.

> &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a couple major labels looking at him,&#8221; [Corle&#8217;s agent] says. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t even expect this, 7,000 hits in less than 2 weeks.&#8221;

Yikes. No mention that &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RVq8J-ePjA" target="_blank">German Soccer Coach Picks Nose and Eats It</a>&#8221; has over 12,400 views or that &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjiEYwq7gS4" target="_blank">Sportscaster Jim Knox Shows Off His Ball Sweat</a>&#8221; has over 36 thousand views in a week. No, no yours is good though. Still good.

> Corle&#8217;s working on an album &#8212; he says it will be out in December or January &#8212; and plans to shoot another video in October for a new single called &#8220;Digital.&#8221;

Yea! New post material!

Getting back to the main point though: Why on earth is the RFT on this guy&#8217;s jock? Look the song isn&#8217;t Tina E bad, but come on, let&#8217;s me real here. There must be some reason why the Riverfront Times would be so infatuated with bad rap&#8230;
