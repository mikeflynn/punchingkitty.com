Some times you gotta go for the gold and top it all off with a collection of stuff about a dead person that was briefly royalty to a group of people several thousand miles away.

> [Helen] McKenna collects tea pots and tea cups. She collects Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. She owns a collection devoted to all things Popeye.

> But perhaps most prized is her Princess Diana collection.

Not exactly the Smithsonian, but you know what? This $3,000 pile of $24.99 hand-painted (individually numbered!) collectors plates and one, what can only assumed to be a Princess Diana sex doll, isn&#8217;t exactly the Wright Brothers plane. Her husband, who we&#8217;re sure expects to be stuffed and mounted in a Prince Charles outfit upon his death, was only quoted indirectly in the piece. When McKenna was asked if she was a &#8220;collector&#8217;s collector&#8221;:

> &#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;m a big one,&#8221; McKenna said. &#8220;My husband says he&#8217;s happy we have a two-story house.&#8221;

What we&#8217;re sure he meant to say was that a heroin addiction would have been cheaper with far shorter suffering period for her family. &#8230;oh and speaking of which!

> &#8220;I told my granddaughter if I die it belongs to you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Never sell it, pass it down.&#8221;

Also being passed down will be 6 cats, loneliness and some crippling depression.
