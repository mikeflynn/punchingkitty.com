**Updated!**  _See below original post&#8230;_

We hear Emmis, the radio company that operates 105.7 the Point, 97.1, KSHE, and KHITS, has stopped paying for their employee&#8217;s parking passes at their Union Station office.

What does this mean? Yup. Emmis&#8217; poor underpaid jocks now have to pay to park at work.

Lame and sad.

Well, at least they have all those fabulous shops in Union Station to hang out at&#8230;oh wait.

**Update:** 

Dana, from the comments and Emmis checks in with this:

> They cover parking. Parking prices have increased and they are merely selective as to whom is issued a swipe pass as opposed to paper passes.

Thanks for the update.  Good to hear things haven&#8217;t gotten _that_ bad yet.
