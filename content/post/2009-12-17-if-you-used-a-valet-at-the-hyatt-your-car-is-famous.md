For all the awesome things the internet does, one of its greatest powers is always overlooked.  &#8220;What is this power?&#8221; you ask so this article will flow the way I want it to&#8230;  Well catching people committing crimes when they post a video of them doing it on YouTube like freaking morons!

> Kyle O&#8217;Brien didn&#8217;t know anything had happened to his 2004 Dodge until he saw his car being abused on FOX 2 Tuesday night, &#8220;I&#8217;m not freaking out about it, but it isn&#8217;t that funny,&#8221; says OBrien. &#8220;I would just think a valet service at a nice hotel would have to have more responsibility.&#8221;

> Someone calling himself &#8220;valet underground&#8221; posted dozens of videos on YouTube, showing fancy cars being driven to the extreme in a parking garage about six months to a year ago.

Clearly when you are valet, there are extreme steps you must take to feel like a man before going to home to mom&#8217;s house to play World of Warcraft before spanking it to old issues of Teen People.

Now the YouTube account for &#8220;valet underground&#8221; has been closed and the Hyatt is looking for a new valet company, and that guy&#8217;s car got to drive over the speed limit for once so everyone&#8217;s a winner!

A copy of the video obtained by <a href="http://www.fox2now.com/news/ktvi-valet-abuse-cars-hyatt-121509,0,6905487.story" target="_blank">Fox2</a> has been embedded below.  Its like a rap video, but with less chicks but more four-door sedans&#8230;really nice family cars.  You know its funny, all those kids rappers have but none of them drive cars that you can easily get a car seat in and out of.
