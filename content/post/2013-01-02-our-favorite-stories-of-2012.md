The goal was to get this up on New Year&#8217;s Eve, but it didn&#8217;t happen as we were blessed with hang0ver-like symptoms a day early without having to work through all that &#8220;drinking&#8221;, &#8220;having fun&#8221; and &#8220;inappropriately touching girls at bars&#8221; stuff! Fun times.

List Notes: We&#8217;ve already posted the top 10 lists based on what you, the readers, like the most and so we made sure we didn&#8217;t duplicate anything from those lists. We love those posts too, but why talk about the same post three times? Also instead of doing the usual top 10 format, we thought we&#8217;d go at it a little differently this year because as much as people love &#8220;top 10&#8221; lists, they also seem to really get a kick out of fake awards given out to friends and advertisers. So here we are, giving out awards to the people we like the most: Us.

#### The best time we forced a local news station to remove their reporter&#8217;s overt bias from a story :

> Horrible job KMOV. Time to tell the 12 year old “backpack reporter” to scoop up his colored pencils and hit the road.
> 
> Actually, hold on. Do those _colored_ pencils have an alibi? We don’t recall the police mentioning them either, so by your logic they are clearly a prime suspect…especially that Brown one. White and Peach? You’re free to go.

#### The best &#8220;Wow, How Is This Always So Relevant?&#8221; story:

    You think an Islamic family living in St. Louis can’t figure out where to find some information on Christianity? They’re only surrounded by churches, Christian neighbors, friends and co-workers, but no, you’re right. Lets swing by their kid’s school just to be safe.
