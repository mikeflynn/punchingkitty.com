  <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/03/25/the-old-rock-houses-new-website-has-already-been-hacked/" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/03/hackers.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9476" title="hackers" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/03/hackers.jpeg?filter=resize&w=600" alt="" /></a>It was just Friday when we told you about the new website for local concert venue The Old Rock House (<a href="http://www.oldrockhouse.com" target="_blank">www.oldrockhouse.com</a>, but I&#8217;d avoid clicking on that if you&#8217;re still rocking Internet Explorer.) and how it was really creepy and we didn&#8217;t get the whole &#8220;duct-taped girl&#8221; motif they were going for&#8230;oh that&#8217;s right they were hacked! Later that night it was fixed though, the creepy taped girl was expunged and the Old Rock House&#8217;s website full of photos from concerts by people we&#8217;ve never heard of was restored.

&#8230;and now they&#8217;re hacked again.

You know, setting your password to &#8220;theoldrockhouse&#8221; probably seemed like a brillant method to avoid a post-it note, but then things like this happen and you start to think &#8220;Maybe I should pick a harder password, like my kid&#8217;s first name, or wait&#8230;of course! &#8216;theoldrockhouse**1**&#8216;! This is even smarter than me putting my wallet in my shoes at the beach before I go in the water. Stupid crooks&#8230;they never think to look in the toe.&#8221;

If Dade Murphy is behind this he better watch out! One more misstep and he could lose his scholarship!
