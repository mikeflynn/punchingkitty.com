Wentzville High grad, 6th pick in the draft a few years ago and current Washington National&#8217;s starting pitcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28895" target="_blank">Ross Detwiler</a> is out for three months after undergoing surgery to repair torn right hip cartilage.

No word yet if the wound was self-inflicted when he realized he had to go back to Spring Training for the Nationals.
