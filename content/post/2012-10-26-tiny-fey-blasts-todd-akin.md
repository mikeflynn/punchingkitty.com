> &#8220;If I have to listen to one more grey-faced man with a $2 haircut explain to me what rape is,” she warned, “I’m going to lose my mind!”

That was _Saturday Night Live_ alum, current _30 Rock_ star, and not-so-secret-crush ours Tina Fey speaking Wednesday to the attendees of the Center for Reproductive Rights Inaugural Gala in New York.

Fey did specifically mention everyone&#8217;s favorite creepy retarded uncle and wanna be Missouri Senator Todd Akin&#8230;

> Todd Akin claims that women can’t really get pregnant from a legitimate rape because the body secretes hormones &#8212; you know what, I can’t even finish this sentence without getting dumber&#8230;It&#8217;s something about the body not being able to get pregnant when it&#8217;s under physical stress. Mr. Akin, I think you&#8217;re confusing the phrase &#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; with competitive gymnastics.

That&#8217;s a good line, but confusing rape with competitive gymnastics is no laughing matter. The police aren&#8217;t all that understanding of brain farts like that when yelled from the window of your van towards a busy school playground.
