Though there is still the matter of the clivil case, this is a huge deal for Jackson who, to his credit, has handled this well stating in a release that it was no guilty of the crimes and the process would speak to that. Â So far so good for Jackson and, in turn, the Rams.

In a related story the Rams are terrible.
