Our crack investigative team has uncovered an internal memo that Tony LaRussa sent his &#8220;underling&#8221; General Manager John Mozeliak apparently, just after the close of the 2010 season.

It&#8217;s been a rough go so far, and while no one knows what the rest of the season will hold, it appears that &#8220;Mo&#8221; has pleased his Hall of Fame manager boss by completing the plan just ahead of schedule! Nicely done John! You might have just earned yourself a back slap the next time you do your usual &#8220;feed Tony peeled grapes&#8221; post-game ritual.
