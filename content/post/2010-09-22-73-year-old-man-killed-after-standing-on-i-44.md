A 73-year old Charles Bartlett was struck and killed while standing in front of on-coming traffic on I-44 near St. James, MO.

> The Missouri State Highway Patrol says Charles Bartlett of St. James was struck Monday night. The patrol says he was hit by a car as he stood in the eastbound passing lane near St. James, and died at the scene.
> 
> It wasn&#8217;t clear why Bartlett was in the driving lane of the interstate

So is this like <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/07/maybe-you-shouldnt-cross-the-highway-on-foot/" target="_blank">a fad now or something</a>? A woman also was <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Pedestrian-struck-in-south-St-Louis-103427099.html" target="_blank">killed yesterday crossing Kings Highway on foot.</a>

We feel, for the general safety of the public, that maybe we should all just cross busy roads and highway at appropriate places and instead bring back slap bracelets.
