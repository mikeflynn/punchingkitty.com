They even went to the trouble of bringing up that very Facebook profile in question, blowing it up on the large video monitor beside the reporter.

One thing though: He&#8217;s an uncharged minor. You aren&#8217;t supposed to be blasting his name everywhere!

It&#8217;s cool though, they thought about that little fact&#8230;about 5 seconds too late.

Thanks KSDK. That&#8217;s probably all the &#8220;protecting&#8221; the kid can take today.

We aren&#8217;t sure of the ramifications for their quick legal blunder, but even it amounts to nothing, this is still pretty bad. We also still can&#8217;t figure out why they would put the profile up on the big screen if they knew they shouldn&#8217;t be showing it. In our mind, everything was cool until the minute they showed that boy&#8217;s name and some old guy in the back that&#8217;s worked there for years and hasn&#8217;t talked in months yelled out &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that! It&#8217;s agains the law!&#8221; Old guys always know the law better than anyone. Probably why the always vote and read the news and stuff. We don&#8217;t have time for that crap because of all the loud music we listen to while we horseplay.

What?! Transcripts are good enough you say? Good thing our eagle-eyed tip-daddy managed to grab a little video evidence of the &#8220;minor&#8221; mistake (Click through the jump to see the video)
