In a report <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_68047543-30a7-50ec-94d6-79e71b8f29b9.html" target="_blank">by Blythe Bernhard on STLToday.com</a>:

> Youths in the city are killed by gun violence more often than in any other city except New Orleans, according to federal data released Thursday.

&#8230;and New Orleans doesn&#8217;t really count since it&#8217;s like those tennis shoes that got really wet one weekend. Sure you kept them, but you&#8217;re not wearing them any more even after they dried out because now they smell funny.

> The city&#8217;s gunshot murder rate for 10- to 19-year-olds is more than three times the average for major cities, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
> 
> &#8230;a survey last year by St. Louis Children&#8217;s Hospital found that two to three times more gunshot and stabbing victims are treated at the hospital compared with other urban children&#8217;s hospitals.

Ok&#8230;ok&#8230;that sounds bad&#8230;but why do they always have to phrase it all negative like that. What not say &#8220;St. Louis youths begin unsanctioned population control program?&#8221; &#8230;which is still not the best thing they could be doing with their time, but at least it sounds like they&#8217;re experimenting. Why are we always focusing on the kids for that matter? Try this one for size: &#8220;St. Louis hospitals not getting better at saving gun shot victims despite all the practice&#8221; It&#8217;s all about spin! &#8230;well that and all the gun fire.
