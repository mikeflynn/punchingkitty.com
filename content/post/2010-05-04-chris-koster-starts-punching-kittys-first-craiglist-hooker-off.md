So Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster is whining about Craiglist again.

> Koster met with representatives from craigslist exactly a year ago, demanding the company take action to eliminate advertisements for prostitution and other illegal activities on its site. Nine days after the meeting, craigslist announced major changes to its site, including eliminating the “erotic services” section and manually screening for nude photos and illegal activities such as prostitution.
> 
> Despite all this, Koster and other state attorneys general have found that prostitutions [sic] ads are still found on craigslist.

Gasp! Oh no!

We can&#8217;t imagine the pain people possibly hooking on Craiglist is causing Chris Koster. I hear his wife won&#8217;t give it up knowing that you can actually get paid for that as opposed to her gig that entails fake smiling at events and all the dress suits she can fit in her closet.

&#8230;also&#8230;um&#8230;you just &#8220;found&#8221; them huh? &#8230;ok. Well we want to look too! Lets go find some Craigslist hooker ads!

Our first Craiglist Hooker (above) hails from &#8220;sexytown&#8221; (sounds made up) and says she &#8220;is the one.&#8221; So, stop looking!  Also her name is Ms. Passion which, to us, seems like quite a coincidence that with that name she ended up being a hooker.

It&#8217;s the small touches that we appreciate. Don&#8217;t even bother heading her direction unless you are in for a naughty time&#8230;oh you are? Forget we said anything then.

Lastly we have this lovely creature hailing from &#8220;Fifteen minutes from Downtown&#8221; which we hear is lovely this time of year. She spends her time posing in front of vinyl siding and secretly being a dude. Yup. It&#8217;s a dude.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

So which one of these horrible menaces to society are you going to vote for? Vote on any standard you like. We don&#8217;t care. Just know that posts like the ones we reference are horrible things and need to be removed from society because its clear these well&#8230;women&#8230;whatever&#8230;are forcing people to go and look at their ads and purchase their services. This is huge problem we need our Attorney General on 100%, isn&#8217;t that right homeless guy, SLU rape victims, old people being ripped off by email scams and other people who could actually use help?

Way to go Chris Koster.
