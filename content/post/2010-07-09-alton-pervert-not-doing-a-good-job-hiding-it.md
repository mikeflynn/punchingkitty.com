<a rel="attachment wp-att-5449" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/09/alton-pervert-not-doing-a-good-job-hiding-it/scott_pyle/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5449" title="scott_pyle" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/scott_pyle.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="229" /></a>Scott Pyle, 50, was arrested and charged with inappropriate contact with a minor after a report from a mother who claimed Pyle sexually assaulted her daughter at his home in February.

When they asked for proof, the mother just showed them a picture of Pyle&#8230;the police deemed his overt creepiness enough for an arrest.

The Alton police are also working on trying to charge Pyle with a number of other creepy unsolved crimes like being that guy that stands too close to you on the empty elevator or being the uncle that hugs your girlfriend a little longer than he should.

Also the fact that Pyle&#8217;s not wearing any pants in this mugshot should be of little surprise.
