Tony LaRussa doesn&#8217;t like to lose. We&#8217;ve heard good friends will be in town to have a meal with the man, and if the Cardinals loose that night, he won&#8217;t go. That&#8217;s mean, but that&#8217;s Tony. He can be a hard-nosed competitive, and frankly, mean guy some times. Hell <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g64Ae58SvEk" target="_blank">look at him go at STLToday sports writer Bernie Miklasz</a>.

&#8230;and then he&#8217;ll go do something like this:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4462" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/11/tony-larussa-is-going-to-be-on-whatever-the-hell-housecat-housecall-is/gom_061206b/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4462" title="gom_061206b" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/gom_061206b.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>&#8230;and we love every second of these moments.  We can&#8217;t get enough of stuff like this. I mean, how could you? Which is why we couldn&#8217;t have been happier to see that our friends at <a href="http://www.cardsdiaspora.com/2010-articles/may/larussa-to-appear-on-qhousecat-housecallq.html" target="_blank">Cards Diaspora.com</a> got their hands on new promo photos of LaRussa and family appearing on some show called _Housecat Housecall_ which sounds just awful. I mean really really awful. Like watching Kirstie Alley eat spaghetti with her hands awful.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4463" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/11/tony-larussa-is-going-to-be-on-whatever-the-hell-housecat-housecall-is/larussa/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4463" title="larussa" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/larussa.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="546" height="774" /></a>Yup. Looks awful.

The site is described on <a href="http://www.housecathousecall.com/AboutTheShow.aspx" target="_blank">their site</a> as

> Each week, Dr. Katrina visits cat loving [f]amilies and, with the help of the Housecat Housecall<sup>®</sup>Mentors, Dr. Karen Sueda and Dr. Rich Goldstein, she&#8217;ll try to make some sense out of a wide range of feline puzzlers. Whether it&#8217;s just a quirky behavior or something more complex, Dr. Katrina and her team work out real solutions that help bring peace, harmony, and well-being back to the homes of cats and owners.

Clearly we&#8217;re cool with the whole cat thing, but on Tony. You&#8217;re better than this. Also you don&#8217;t see Jose Oquendo doing this stuff&#8230;just sayin&#8217;.

If anything deserves a cat face-palm it&#8217;s this.
