Five minutes long. Not a word.

Oh and he&#8217;s made **nearly 2,000** more videos, _just like this one!_

We have no freaking clue what the point of any of this (pretty sure its probably a &#8220;sexy to someone&#8221; kinda deal)&#8230;but we felt like it was worth sharing.

(Video after the jump which we aren&#8217;t guessing you&#8217;re going to click through to see it, so we also include a photo of Natalie Portman making out with Jessica Alba while Darth Maul and the Easter Bunny have a lightsaber battle in the background.)
