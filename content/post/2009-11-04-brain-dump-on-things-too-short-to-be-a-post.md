  * The Moonrise Hotel is great for the Loop, but horrible for Delmar. The street just can&#8217;t handle it.  If one person heading east wants to turn in to the Moonrise it backs up traffic all the way through the Loop.
  * The Cardinals aren&#8217;t going to re-sign Matt Holliday.  Deal with it.
  * Batman couldn&#8217;t really get around very well in St. Louis in his usual rooftop style.  There are too many breaks in the buildings.
  * There are too many Thai restaurants in the Loop.  Please eliminate three.
  * Dear 101 ESPN, you aren&#8217;t &#8220;the all new&#8221; anything any more.  Please knock that crap off and spend the money for new bumpers.
