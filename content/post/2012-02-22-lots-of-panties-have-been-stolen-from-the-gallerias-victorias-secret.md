If Victoria&#8217;s secret was that you can just walk in to the store and take a arm load of panties off a table and walk out without anyone noticing, then the secret&#8217;s out.

> Police are currently investigating the theft of over 100 pairs of underwear from a display table at the St. Louis Galleria in Richmond Heights.
> 
> The theft reportedly occurred at the Victoria’s Secret store inside the mall on Valentine&#8217;s Day.

100 pairs of panties? That sounds like a lot, but we&#8217;re talking Victoria&#8217;s Secret here, so wadded up in to a ball they were just about enough to fill some cargo pants. Sure they could have stolen the &#8220;big girl&#8221; panties, but they don&#8217;t put those sizes out on tables! That kind of stuff is kept in a drawer, in the basement&#8230;behind a auto locking gate just above the trap door that empties in to a crocodile pit.

Yup, there&#8217;s a crocodile pit in the Galleria. True story. They actually pick the croc&#8217;s teeth and use those shredded remains for that Charley&#8217;s Grilled Subs place. Think about that next time that high school kid with the tray offers you a free sample.
