Its all very sad and I hope what they did helps, but this lady above, picture on STLToday.com with the story is a horrible sign maker.

It starts off great with the big &#8220;Are you part of the problem?&#8221;,  but the sign takes a quick nose dive with the suddenly small, un-level and sometimes oddly faint writing below.  Take some time, think about your message first and then shorten it to 1-2 lines and for christ sake, use a ruler or something to keep the lines straight.

Maybe an example will help.  This is a good sign:

In fact, maybe just hire this guy and solve two problems at once.
