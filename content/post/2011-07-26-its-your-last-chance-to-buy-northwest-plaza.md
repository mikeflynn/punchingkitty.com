If you told me that you have $1.5 Million to spend and really love open spaces that used to be filled with long-since empty stores and cart after cart of hair extension and bedazzled cell phone cases, then do we have the place for you!

> Northwest Plaza Mall and 500 Office Tower is a one- and two-story super regional mall with a 12-story office building that has 1,829,261 square feet of gross leasable area in St. Ann, a suburb in St. Louis. The mall is currently 8.54% occupied and the office portion is 47.29% occupied. Overall occupancy is 11.87%. The center was formerly anchored by Macy&#8217;s, Sears, Dillard&#8217;s, and Steve and Barry&#8217;s, though all anchors have vacated as of the date of appraisal. Additional outparcel stores include a vacant Toys R Us and vacant The Bedroom Store.

Possible uses for a great space like this include laser tag or a lair for any future plans of world domination as a super villain. It&#8217;s the perfect lair! It&#8217;s inconveniently located in North St. Louis, meaning no one, not people, not cops will want to go there. You might as well be on a skull shaped island! The old Dillard&#8217;s would be the perfect location for a lava pit to hang spies over and the abandoned Toys R Us? No better place to dramatically appear in front of the hero sitting on a throne of pool noodles on top of a pile of scary doll heads.

&#8230;plus you can always fall back on the laser tag idea until your death ray is ready.
