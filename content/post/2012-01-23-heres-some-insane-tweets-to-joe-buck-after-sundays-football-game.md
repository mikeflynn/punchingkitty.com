Poor Joe Buck (<a href="http://twitter.com/buck" target="_blank">@buck</a> on Twitter), he just can&#8217;t win. The St. Louis native is always a dick to your team.Which team? _Your_ team. &#8230;No wait. Of the two teams that played in Sunday&#8217;s NFC championship game, which one did he hate specifically? The one that you liked.

Of course not everyone is team specific. Other&#8217;s just have career advice:

Laugh now, but a small part of you thought Buck heaped a little too much praise on Mike Napoli in the World Series didn&#8217;t you?!
