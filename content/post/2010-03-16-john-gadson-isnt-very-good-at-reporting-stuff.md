**Update:** _Fox2&#8217;s Charlie Marlow wasn&#8217;t happy about this post because John Gadson had a brain tumor that caused these symptoms, which was unknown at the time. Marlow sent us a lovely note about it._ _<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/15/we-got-fanmail-from-fox2s-charlie-marlow-last-night/" target="_blank">We disagree on its level of hypocrisy.</a> Obviously we wish John the best in his battle with cancer._

_Original post follows&#8230;_

According to local news station KTVI, Fox 2 <a href="http://www.fox2now.com/about/station/newsteam/ktvi-johngadson-825446,0,1439785.story" target="_blank">John Gadson</a> has been a reporter there for 10 years which is surprising since I&#8217;ve  never seen him before until this report crossed our desk. We&#8217;re starting to understand why, and so will you if you watch the video of his latest &#8220;reporting&#8221; below.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KDxyGAO7w9o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Wait. Was this about a juvenile?  I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was about a juvenile because Gadson didn&#8217;t say juvenile enough so it was tough to tell if this report was about a juvenile. Juvenile.

Something tells me that if the cameraman panned back a bit you&#8217;d find Gadson wasn&#8217;t wearing any pants&#8230;or maybe he had to bottom half of a chicken costume on. We are happy to see the man he interviewed played along and pretended he was actually involved by making up some crap about the lady &#8220;fussing and hollering&#8221;.  After this report, Gadson probably curled up on the ground under a cardboard box and when they went back to him for an update, he was taking a crap behind one of the wrecked cars.

Please tell me that this is some sort of awesome joke and the Fox 2 camera man bet Gadson $20 to do a report with his best Bill Cosby impression. I half expected Gadson to tell me how the juvenile drove his car in to a &#8220;glass, plate glass door&#8221; and then turn around and tell me to try a pudding pop. (Gadson shown below holding a pudding pop.)

Also note that at some point you can hear Tom O&#8217;neil back at the studio about to lose his shit watching amateur hour which makes me like Tom O&#8217;neil a little more than before, which is to say I now remember who Tom O&#8217;neil is.
