You&#8217;re doing what now?

> Blue lights are flooding the Gateway One Building Wednesday evening. Lumiere Place and fountains in Kiener Plaza and at Citygarden are also going blue

Oh&#8230;we get it. No we don&#8217;t.

> It&#8217;s part of a national campaign that encourages people around the country to start a conversation about autism in their community by hosting a blue event during Autism Awareness Month.

Awesome. Great. &#8230;but the connection to blue is&#8230;

We at Punching Kitty don&#8217;t follow things we don&#8217;t understand, so to for &#8220;Raise Autism Awareness&#8221; Day over at the headquarters we spilled and counted tooth picks, screamed every time we saw a doggie, entertained ourselves to a photo of <a href="http://www.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=Jenny+McCarthy&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=LA7ZS_uyDIzCNtCcnY8K&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CB4QsAQwAA" target="_blank">Jenny McCarthy</a>, and then felt bad about it afterwards.

&#8230;when we were done with all that we looked up what Autism was.
