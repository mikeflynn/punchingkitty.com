Found on YouTube: A video taken by someone that waited a very long time to get to the front of the Zac Efron line when he came into town for a showing of his movie Charlie St. Cloud at Ronnies in South County.

You can hear screams of &#8220;I love your hair!&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave!&#8221; throughout the clip. Also, if you look closely, a pigeon tries to poop on Efron at one point but a beautiful bald eagle swoops by at the last second to kill the pigeon. Afterwards Efron commented that if it had pooped on his successfully he would have kept going &#8220;Its not like I&#8217;m some little bitch or something.&#8221;

Also seen here is a picture we drew of the St. Louis media beating this dead horse (we&#8217;re on the right with the cape and the badass lightsaber):
