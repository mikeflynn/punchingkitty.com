I have no idea where Lexington, Missouri is and frankly I don&#8217;t want to know because a family was recently arrested there and&#8230;well&#8230;tell &#8217;em block quote:

> Burrell Jr. of Independence, his three brothers, his father and an uncle have all been arrested. Their alleged victims have made allegations of years of rape and incest,

Dude.

> [&#8230;] including mock weddings

Awww, dude.

> [&#8230;] and claims that children were forced to kill a 300-pound man who had been kidnapped

Dude!

> [&#8230;] and that a sex slave was confined in a crawl space.

Eh&#8230;can&#8217;t fault them there. I&#8217;m not sure where else you would put a sex slave.

Holy sh*t. That has got to be the most F-ed up family ever.  Look, lets not be naive, &#8220;rape and incest&#8221; happen enough in families, its not news&#8230;mock weddings though?  That&#8217;s like the rape version of twisting the knife.  Not only am I going to rape you, but we have to pretend like we are getting married first so you have to think about how I&#8217;m going to rape you while we do this imaginary wedding and then, I would assume, an imaginary reception.

I bet that father-daughter dance was awkward as hell!
