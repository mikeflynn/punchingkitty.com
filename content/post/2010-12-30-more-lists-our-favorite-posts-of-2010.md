<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/12/29/year-ending-lists-2010s-most-read-posts/" target="_blank">Yesterday we gave you the top 10 stories from Punching Kitty based on hard traffic numbers</a>, today we have a list purely picked because we liked them the best. Favoritism at it&#8217;s finest. We picked this list completely independently from the previous &#8220;traffic&#8221; list so yes, there are a few on this one that also happened to get a lot of traffic.

Since we took care of the &#8220;wow what a year&#8221; crap in the last list, we won&#8217;t repeat the same stuff here and instead just hit you right in the face with #10:

### 10. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/01/fox2s-web-center-is-apparently-a-closet-with-a-computer-in-it/" target="_blank">Fox2′s “Web Center” is Apparently a Closet With a Computer in it</a>

First on our list was a little post based on a little statement thrown out by local news channel Fox 2 when we had a video of theirs on in the background while looking for something to write about: &#8220;Live in the &#8220;Web Center,&#8221; George Sells. Fox 2 News.&#8221;

> Ok this thing is a converted closet isn’t it?! It has to be. Somewhere there is a janitor pissed off he can’t keep his mop there anymore. Why go the trouble of calling this clearly random room with an outlet on one of the walls the “Web Center”…is it because this room has the good power strip?

Oh local news, you never cease to amaze us with your egotistical lameness.

### 9. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/15/kmovs-virginia-kerr-had-her-baby-told-twitter-all-about-it/" target="_blank">KMOV’s Virginia Kerr Had Her Baby, Told Twitter ALL About It</a>

 <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/15/kmovs-virginia-kerr-had-her-baby-told-twitter-all-about-it/" target="_blank"></a>Dupe! We mentioned this one on <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/12/29/year-ending-lists-2010s-most-read-posts/#more-8391" target="_blank">the other list</a>. Nothing more to add.

### 8. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/06/10-st-louis-tips-for-the-hollidays/" target="_blank">10 St. Louis Tips for the Hollidays</a>

It seems like forever ago now, but it was just early January, 2010 when the Cardinals threw down the big bucks for outfielder Matt Holliday.  We celebrated with &#8220;Matt Holliday Day&#8221; and took a moment to give a little present to our new St. Louis residents: Some tips and a map&#8230;

> 2. If you ever drive west so far that don’t see gay or black people anymore, you’ve gone past 270.  Turn around.
> 
> 3. Try the Imo’s.  Even if you don’t like it, say you do.

> 6. Keep this map we made you on you to find out where and where NOT to go. (Circles are good)

### 7. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/10/cinco-de-mayo-on-cherokee-street/" target="_blank">Cinco de Mayo on Cherokee Street</a>

When pressed to name our favorite little of all the yearly St. Louis festivals and goings-on, Cherokee Street&#8217;s Cinco de Mayo will always be on that list. This year was no exception, with good food, crazy Mexican music we didn&#8217;t understand but others seemed to enjoy and lots of good photo opportunities. Our favorite was this shot from the parade:

### 6. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/29/get-your-2010-st-louis-themed-halloween-costumes-right-here/" target="_blank">Get Your 2010 St. Louis Themed Halloween Costumes Right Here</a>

Anything were we got to Photoshop a zombie Tony LaRussa (which we really impressed ourselves with) and create a wig for Larry Rice that&#8217;s more realistic than he&#8217;s used to has to make the top ten list.

Oh, there was one other costume we made, but we&#8217;ll talk about that drunk <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">little</span> fella later&#8230;or just click #6 to see it now. A reminder: You&#8217;re an adult, so if you want to print out our costume and wear it tomorrow night, you go right ahead.

### 5. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/06/so-about-that-whole-ksdk-interview/" target="_blank">So, About That Whole KSDK Interview…</a>

We mentioned the famed &#8220;Cardinals Craigslist&#8221; piece in our last list, and briefly touched on the press it got, this post fleshes that part of the story about a bit more. We like to think that, even with all the other stabs we take a people every day, this piece is our best &#8220;go fuck yourself&#8221; work of the year.

If KSDK ever calls you to be on the news because your trailer or some crap got turned over, read this first.

### 4. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/the-worst-music-video-ever-was-shot-in-a-st-louis-condos-kitchen/" target="_blank">The Worst Music Video Ever Was Shot in a St. Louis Condo’s Kitchen</a>

&#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; was a local rap video made hyper-local by appearing in front of every building in the metro area while cutting back to an apartment&#8217;s kitchen where it was raining George Washingtons on girls. Actually we just made it sound far better than it actually is.

### 3. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/08/20/dan-mclaughlin-gets-busted-for-drinky-drinky-drivey-drivey/" target="_blank">Dan McLaughlin Gets Busted For Drinky Drinky Drivey Drivey</a>

The second &#8220;dupe&#8221; post between our two lists, so you know the drill. Dan McLaughlin got caught drunk driving on his way home from a charity function. We don&#8217;t need to show you the mug shot again&#8230;but we&#8217;re gonna!

### 2. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/17/the-cardinals-kiss-cam-looking-at-your-fat-ass-isnt-any-better-than-two-dudes/" target="_blank">The Cardinals Kiss Cam: Looking at Your Fat Ass Isn’t Any Better Than Two Dudes</a>

The Cardinals and the homosexual kiss cam controversy captured our attention for nearly a whole weekend and we spent half of that weekend making tons of little fake kiss cam images trying to prove that when hoosiers say &#8220;that&#8217;s the last thing I want to see up there&#8221; they don&#8217;t really mean it. Well, they might think they mean it, plus even if they didn&#8217;t mind the guy kissing the bear, the two fat people or Mini-Me and the doll, then we&#8217;d get them with a photo of a black guy and a mexican guy kissing! &#8230;also one of them is Jewish and the other is a Muslim&#8230;and you can see their car in the background and there isn&#8217;t a yellow ribbon magnet on the back!

Also checkout our follow-up where we just put <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/18/saturday-kiss-cam-hangover-the-top-10-kiss-cam-photoshops/" target="_blank">the best of the Kiss Cam photos</a>. Our favorite was this one:

### 1. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/05/14/crown-candy-record-breaker-lied-about-his-identity/" target="_blank">Crown Candy Record Breaker Lied About His Identity!</a>

We made this list a few days ago but yesterday we found that we came to the same conclusion as the folks over at <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2010/12/crown_candy_kitchen_malt_challenge_imposter.php" target="_blank">Riverfont Time&#8217;s Gut Check blog</a> on what our favorite story of the year was: **The Mysterious Case of the Mystery Milkshake Chugger!**

Seriously it doesn&#8217;t get any weirder than this. Guy just dominates a food challenge, runs away when the TV cameras show up, and tries to hide his identity. The only way this could be anymore weird is if he then txt-ed a photo of his old-man balls to Jenn Sterger.
