_Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix._

It took St. Louis police 3 and a half hours to peaceably coax suspected rapist and comic book shop owner, Kenneth McClure, to put down his weapon and come out of his south Hampton store, **Legends Comics & Sports Cards**.

> Police said McClure was armed when the officers arrived and refused to leave the building. They said he was the only person involved.
> 
> &#8220;Several officers were inside the location but had not yet taken the suspect into custody, when the suspect drew a weapon,&#8221; a police statement said. &#8220;The officers were able to take cover and radio for backup.&#8221;
> 
> The Special Weapons and Tactics Team and a negotiator were called, police said. About 6:35 p.m, the officers inside left safely.

McClure, who you might know from other rapings such as &#8220;No Money For that Comic? There Are Other Forms of Payment!&#8221; and &#8220;We Keep All Our Girl Comics in the Back&#8221;, has been accused of the first-degree rape of a thirteen year old girl&#8230;and now probably also something about pulling a weapon on police.

Dueling Simpsons references aside, this guy is disgusting on multiple levels if the accusations are true, but either way he&#8217;s screwed now since guys that standoff with the cops generally don&#8217;t get probation, they go to prison. How do you think comic book guys do in federal &#8220;pound you in the ass&#8221; prison?  Not well. Maybe his lawyer Lionel Hutz can get him off on a technicality, but we doubt it. The St. Louis circuit judge has had it out for Hutz every since he accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace “accidentally” with “repeatedly” and replace “dog” with “son.”
