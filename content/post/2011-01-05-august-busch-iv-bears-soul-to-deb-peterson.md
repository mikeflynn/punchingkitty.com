[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8351" title="adrienne-nicole-martin" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/12/adrienne-nicole-martin.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="235" />][1]So it&#8217;s come to this **August Busch IV**&#8230;now you&#8217;re waxing philosophical to <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_44d6e75c-a2ea-5bb7-94da-ea131ca86d46.html" target="_blank">STLToday&#8217;s Deb Peterson</a>? Jesus dude, our number is pretty easy to remember: 314-266-TIPS We&#8217;re a great freaking shoulder to cry on! We&#8217;ll hit you with the highlights anyway.

Regardless it appears that Busch isn&#8217;t dealing with the stress of losing his girlfriend, Adrienne Martin, well, especially after the takeover of his company. A takeover that was, and apparently still is, very difficult to deal with.

> The death of Martin, 27, comes in the wake of the sale of Anheuser-Busch, which he led as chief executive, to Belgian brewer InBev — a move that threw him into the depression with which he still struggles.
> 
> &#8220;I would have given up my life to save the company,&#8221; Busch said, &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;

According to Busch, things were going well in his relationship with Martin. The two were on a date the day before that Busch describes with a little dramatic flair:

> On the day before Martin died, Busch said, he took Adrienne Martin &#8220;for her first and her last helicopter ride.&#8221;

Jesus dude. &#8220;Her first and last helicopter ride&#8221;? Who talks like that? Who goes on helicopter rides?!

> The ride on Dec. 18 was &#8220;just for fun because she had never been in a helicopter before. I just bought a helicopter because I&#8217;m going to start flying helicopters again.&#8221;

Oh. Well if you are going to start flying helicopters again&#8230;

The death of his girlfriend seems particularly hard since he admits that this is the first girl he didn&#8217;t want to treat like crap.

> &#8220;She was the only girl I&#8217;ve ever been with that I didn&#8217;t want to have someone on the side,&#8221; Busch said. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m this notorious bachelor who always wanted someone on the side, but I didn&#8217;t with Adrienne.&#8221;

Busch disputes the claim of a 42 minute gap between finding her body and calling 911. He describes the incident as&#8230;

> &#8220;Probably about 11 (a.m.), I got up. Both of us, I thought, were sleeping,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I went to the kitchen to make her a special shake. I came back and tried to wake her up, and I couldn&#8217;t. I checked for a pulse, and then I called Mike (Jung) and he checked, too.&#8221;

As we&#8217;ve talked about before, Martin&#8217;s ex-husband is a medical doctor and has postulated that her death could have been because of a heart condition called &#8220;Long QT Syndrome&#8221;. Busch&#8217;s admission that Martin was taking the sleeping medication Trazodone was a shock to him:

> [Dr. Kevin Martin] said that it was Busch who told him Adrienne was taking the Trazodone, and that he &#8220;was surprised&#8221; because he discovered she had a heart condition — Long QT syndrome — in a test he administered in 2002. The syndrome can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats.
> 
> Kevin Martin said when someone has a heart condition, &#8220;you can&#8217;t take Trazodone.&#8221;

Hmm.

Lastly, what of Busch IV&#8217;s perma-strained relationship with Busch III?

> &#8220;Dad and I are talking, which is good,&#8221; he said, referring to August Busch III, with whom he has long had strained relations. &#8220;I love you, that&#8217;s what I told him. I love you from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;
> 
> When asked what his father&#8217;s response had been, Busch said his dad told him, &#8220;I love you, too.&#8221;

You know, and this is just us spit-balling here, but if we were getting in to yet another batch of horrible PR in the middle of my third, and probably worst, &#8220;girlfriend issue,&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t want to talk to a straight up beat reporter that&#8217;s going to really grill me. I&#8217;d go with the local paper&#8217;s gossip columnist. Seems like the safer move and a chance to work in &#8220;I love you Dad.&#8221; quotes.

Just an observation.
