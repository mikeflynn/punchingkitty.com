Think you&#8217;re pretty awesome now don&#8217;t you Kansas City, luring Google&#8217;s promise of awesome internet service away from us. Well pat yourselves on the back now because once Google realizes all your internet traffic consists of is people watching YouTube videos of guys getting hit in the balls and posting &#8220;Maybe we can sign Pujols!&#8221; on Royals message boards, they&#8217;ll wish they would have came to the other side of the state first!

> For you lucky Kansas City residents, Google has launched an [informational page][1] outlining what their plans are (it also provides some background about Google itself). The site’s FAQ says that Google hopes to begin building the network by the end of the year and that service should begin in the first quarter of 2012, with plans to roll out to all communities in Kansas City. Once the service is live pricing will be “competitive to what people are paying for Internet access today” though Google hasn’t yet named the plans.

Don&#8217;t get too high on your new friendship with Google Kansas City, there&#8217;s a good chance when they start to roll out your internet, they won&#8217;t know where to go!
