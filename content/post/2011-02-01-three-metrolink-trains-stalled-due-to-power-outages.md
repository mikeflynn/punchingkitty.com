_Updated with comment from Metro! (See below)_

Three different MetroLink trains had to evacuate their riders yesterday when they lost power due to the &#8220;historic&#8221; ice storms hitting the city limits. When ice encases the power line that runs across the track, then the trains aren&#8217;t going anywhere, but at least all the riders could easily be evacuated&#8230;

> The biggest problem happened on the Shrewsbury line around 5:30 Monday evening. A train lost power on a bridge in Brentwood and was stuck on the bridge for an hour and a half to two hours.

&#8230;er&#8230;um&#8230;well at least those people weren&#8217;t left stranded out in the cold. The trains have heaters of course&#8230;

> Metro was not sure if the train had working heaters.

Of course they didn&#8217;t. At least it was probably super comfortable on there otherwise with the usual MetroLink suspects: Stinky Guy, Girl chewing Gum Loudly, Dude With a Bike, and Obviously a Rapist Guy.

> When I talked with a passenger on the disabled Maplewood train last night via Twitter, he reported that everyone was in decent spirits, and no mention of loss of heat.
