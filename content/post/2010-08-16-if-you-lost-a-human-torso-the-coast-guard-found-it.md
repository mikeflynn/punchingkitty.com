The Coast Guard, which traffics rivers too apparently found a human torso floating in the Mississippi River Sunday just blocks from the Anheuser-Busch Brewery.

> It is unknown if the torso is that of a man or a woman, or how long it may have been in the water. The body will be sent to the medical examiner for further investigation.

Um&#8230;the torso wasn&#8217;t enough to tell if it was a woman? Bummer. Might have been suicide then.

Also, if a dead body floats down river to St. Louis do we still have to count that violent crime on our total? That really doesn&#8217;t seem fair if so. Tell you what&#8230;we&#8217;ll count it has a half.
