In fact, we will be at both St. Louis area Apple stores!  Why? To get an iPad of course and to hang out with some St. Louis Apple-heads. The plan is to hit the West County Mall Apple store bright and early, **around 7am**, and then after getting through that line, heading over to the Galleria to see the crowd there!

We&#8217;ll be there with our video camera and plenty of Punching Kitty stickers so if you want to talk, hunt me down! We&#8217;d love to talk with you about your iPad Holiday experience.

So what are your plans? Do you think this iPad hysteria is just insane? Don&#8217;t you think Punching Kitty will look sexy on there?
