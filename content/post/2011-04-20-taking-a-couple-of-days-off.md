Sorry folks, but we have to do a bit of running around for the next couple of days, and as such, new stuff here will be spotty at best. Things should settle back in by next week at the latest.

In the meantime, enjoy this old Schweig Engel commercial and marvel at the one guy who appears to be playing a overdosed crackhead, while trying to figure out if that&#8217;s Ray Romano or not.
