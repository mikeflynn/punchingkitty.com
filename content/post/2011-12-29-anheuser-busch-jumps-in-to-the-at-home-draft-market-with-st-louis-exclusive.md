While we&#8217;re a little late to the party since it was released a couple of weeks ago to select stores in the St. Louis market, we thought we&#8217;d mention AB&#8217;s Draftmark system anyway because it&#8217;s pretty cool actually [Editor&#8217;s Note: AB supplied a Draftmark system for the Punching Kitty HQ to try out.] and this thing is tailor made for a New Years at home.

The idea is a lot like the Coors and Heineken home drafts, but your draft is reusable with currently three different refills available: Bass, Budweiser and Shock Top.

You have to charge a battery and clip in the refill, but that&#8217;s about it as far as setup, and yes, it does taste bar-worthy.

Currently the whole deal is only available in select St. Louis supermarkets, but the plan is to release it area-wide in February and then expand to other markets down the road. That&#8217;s right! St. Louis first! &#8230;which is why we thought we&#8217;d mention it: AB is letting all of St. Louis be beer hipsters so when it comes out in Chicago or Kansas City we can all say &#8220;Oh that thing? I&#8217;ve had that for months.&#8221; Don&#8217;t go buying your skinny jeans just yet though, remember it&#8217;s only Budweiser, Bass and Shock Top right now, so wait on any ironic t-shirt purchases until they allow you to refill this with crappier beer.
