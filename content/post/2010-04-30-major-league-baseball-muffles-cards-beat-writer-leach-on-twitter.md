Word is out that Major League Baseball has told their employed beat writers, who write for the MLB.com sub-sites for each time, must refrain from &#8220;tweeting&#8221; about anything other than baseball from here on out. These new restrictions hit home for local stlcardinals.com writer Matt Leach who&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewhleach" target="_blank">widely followed Twitter account</a> gets lots of use throughout the day.

Aaron Gleeman reporting for <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/04/mlb-bans-all-beat-writers-from-using-twitter-for-non-baseball-topics.html.php" target="_blank">NBCsports.com</a>

> Multiple sources have confirmed to me that Major League Baseball is cracking down on Twitter usage, ordering MLB.com writers to cease tweeting about all non-baseball topics and scolding players for their Twitter usage in general.
> 
> I&#8217;m told a big part of the policy change is due to MLB not wanting non-baseball tweets showing up on the MLB.com Twitter feed/aggregator, but banning every writer from non-baseball talk because of that is like killing a fly with a sledgehammer.

In fact, after examining Leach&#8217;s twitter activity,  it appears that this mandate may have gone out on April 27th. Not only is that the last appearance of a &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/MatthewHLeach/status/12962522884" target="_blank">non-baseball tweet</a>&#8220;, it was immediately followed by this:

This is so dumb. God forbid the public like a beat writer for anything other than baseball, which they all talk about lots anyway because their freaking beat writers!

I love baseball, but the people in charge make some amazingly short-sighted decisions (Hello MLB.com video blackouts!) far too often.
