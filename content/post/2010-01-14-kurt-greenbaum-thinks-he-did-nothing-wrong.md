Just a little note for our friend Kurt Greenbaum.  After watching a video we received tonight from the guys over at <a href="http://stltomorrow.org/" target="_blank">STLtomorrow</a> of Greenbaum shakily talking about <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/11/19/the-post-dispatchs-social-media-guy-tattles-on-naughty-commenter-craps-on-privacy-policy/" target="_blank">the infamous incident </a>at <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/12/greenbaum-to-giving-tips-about-how-to-handle-new-media/" target="_blank">his recent public appearance</a>, its clear he has no idea what the word means.

From the video (embedded below):

I don&#8217;t know?! I honestly don&#8217;t know if Greenbaum really thinks he did nothing wrong, or if he is just sticking to his retarded guns here.

There was a time where we even felt a little sorry for Greenbaum&#8217;s misguided ass, but he comes off like a self-righteous dick in this video even more than he did in the blog post basically bragging about getting a man fired!

There&#8217;s no point to continue disecting Greenbaum&#8217;s actions.  It was wrong.  Everyone knows it.  Well not everyone.  Just the one guy. It&#8217;s really frustrating when everyone in the world knows something and one poor bastard just can&#8217;t see the truth.

This must be what it&#8217;s like to be around Tom Cruise or Lois Lane.
