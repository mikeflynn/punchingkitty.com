How are we supposed to get amazing AA-list celebrities to come to St. Louis now without the Ameristar Casino&#8217;s HOME nightclub?! The club announced Sunday it has closed its doors, taking with it the chance to see HOME veterans again like Paris Hilton, Danny Masterson, Kim Kardashion and, talent oozing from every pore, Wilber Valderama&#8230;oh god&#8230;that&#8217;s not talent is it? I think that&#8217;s infection left over from Lindsay Lohan. Gross.

Though the press release, sent to a few media outlets on Sunday afternoon, has yet to appear on <a href="http://www.ameristar.com/Press_Releases.aspx" target="_blank">the Ameristar Press Release page</a> (**_Update_**_: Its up now. <a href="http://www.ameristar.com/Press_Release_Preview.aspx?PressId=1334" target="_blank">Link</a>._), <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2010/08/home_nightclub_closed_st_charles_ameristar_casino_st_louis.php" target="_blank">the Riverfront Times quoted this chunk</a>:

> Ameristar Casinos, Inc. has closed HOME Nightclub at Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles. The venue&#8217;s last night of operation was Aug. 22. Ameristar Sr. Vice President and General Manager Jim Franke said that while HOME had met Ameristar&#8217;s standards of quality and excellence in becoming one of St. Louis&#8217; premiere nightclubs, the venue was unable to sustain profitability. &#8220;We want to thank our guests and appreciated their patronage and loyalty in making HOME one of the top nightclubs not only in the St. Louis area, but throughout the Midwest region,&#8221; Franke said. There are no immediate plans to physically change the HOME venue. Franke said Ameristar will continue to use the facility as an exciting high-energy venue for the property&#8217;s group sales business. Despite changes to improve the financial performance of HOME &#8211; including programming and scheduling formats &#8211; the venue was unable to achieve successful financial results, Franke said.

If you can&#8217;t turn a profit with $13 vodka tonics, we aren&#8217;t sure what else can help you.

The real losers in all of this news are the Jersey Shore kids. They lost one of only a few places that would bring them in to &#8220;host&#8221; a party. All they have left now is InsideSTL events at Fifteen.
