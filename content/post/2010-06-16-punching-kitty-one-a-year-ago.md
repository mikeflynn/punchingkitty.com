A year seems so long ago. Isn&#8217;t that what you are supposed to say when you talk about things that were a year ago? We don&#8217;t know. What we do know is that every time we hear the word _long_ we giggle. Well no matter how you start this out, we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of new readers in the last few months, so here are some classics.

[Missed Connections: Get Your Nerd Freak On!][1]

> I know what you are thinking right?  ”I wish there were photos!”  Guess whaaaaaaattttttttt!

[Chris Perez We Hardly Knew Ye][2] 

> Last night the Cardinals acquired the guy every one knew they wanted, Mark DeRosa, from the Cleveland Indians in exchange for “close of the future” Chris Perez

[The Chicago Tribune Writes A Guide to St. Louis][3]

> Just for a second St. Louis think about any other place where you would go along with the whims of a hairy-backed drunk in a sleeveless t-shirt or a 8 year old?  Exactly, nowhere.

> I know  you can find a better photo than that for your Twitter picture!  Just snap off a couple of shots on set tonight, you are definitely looking better than this old headshot these days!
