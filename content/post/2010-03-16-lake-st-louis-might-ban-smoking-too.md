In yet another &#8220;me too&#8221; political action, another St. Louis area is moving to ban smoking.

> City leaders could ban smoking in Lake St. Louis.
> 
> The aldermen could vote on a proposed ban this evening.
> 
> If a ban passes, Lake St. Louis would be the first city in St. Charles County to be smoke free.

Well there&#8217;s something to hang your hat on.  No more smoking in all the fine Lake St. Louis establishments like&#8230;Schnucks&#8230;or&#8230;um&#8230;.Denny&#8217;s.  Wait a minute I see what&#8217;s going on here&#8230;there isn&#8217;t any real need to ban smoking in Lake St. Louis!  This must all be a distraction to what they are really banning!  We did a little research and if you actually really the whole ban you can see what&#8217;s really going down out there somewhere in the haze of look-a-like homes known as &#8220;West of 270 County&#8221;:

Lake St. Louis will create a public ban on SMOKING&#8230;and also the following:

  * Mexicans (<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/01/20/lake-st-louis-creates-way-for-bored-housewives-to-get-rid-of-latino-couple-down-the-street/" target="_blank">seriously</a>)
  * Teenagers
  * Anyone wearing a bandana
  * Any non-pontoon boat related fun.
  * References to Lake of the Ozarks.
  * People named Jamal.
  * Loud music
  * Ironic tshirts
  * Punching Kitty.com

Lake St. Louis might have won this round, but chewing tabacco has never been more powerful.

**Update:** It passed.
