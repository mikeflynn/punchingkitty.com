Steve Jackson couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at himself over seeing this old clip of him in his college years surface on Twitter:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803" title="Picture 5" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-51.png" alt="Picture 5" width="483" height="206" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/Picture-51.png 483w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/Picture-51-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" />][1]

In the video Steven, with then roommate Lawrence Turner, opines: &#8220;A lot of guys brag about their George Forman Grill, well I have the next best thing, a sandwich maker.&#8221;

You still using that sandwich maker Steven?  Maybe on the bye week, I can come by and have some sandwiches?  I&#8217;ll bring the bread.



I&#8217;m going to take a wild guess and say the shoe collection is probably a little bigger now&#8230;oh and I bet he has a better fan too.
