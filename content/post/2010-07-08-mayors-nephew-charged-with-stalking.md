27 year old Benjamin Slay, nephew to St. Louis mayor Francis Slay, has been charged with &#8220;aggravated stalking&#8221; after violating a court order by coming in contact with&#8230;well&#8230;someone he wasn&#8217;t supposed to.

The victim or their connection to Slay has not been released. Its gotta be an ex of some sort though right?

It would be cooler though if it tied in to another St. Louis celeb. Like maybe he was stalking Ted Drewes. Yeah! Lets get this rumor going. You tell 2 people and so will we!
