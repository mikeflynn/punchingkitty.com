An armored car was running through a standard pickup at the Shop &#8216;n Save off Chippewa next to the new-ish Wendy&#8217;s that finally allow us to get a freaking junior bacon cheese burger and a vanilla frosty from time to time, when a man put a gun in the back of the armored car&#8217;s &#8220;runner&#8221;. After being handed a couple of bags of money, the man ran off on foot (probably to the Wendy&#8217;s first, since it&#8217;s like the only one around).

Don&#8217;t worry, we aren&#8217;t exactly talking about a scene from The Town here. This moron was caught fairly quickly at a home &#8220;very near&#8221; the robbery&#8217;s location. How did they catch the armed thug so quickly? The St. Louis police are great at what they do! &#8230;also this guy was apparently a grade-A dipshit.

If you have the cops calling you out on you dumbass-ery then it must have been something pretty dumb he left behind at the scene of the crime. Here&#8217;s a list of guesses:

1. Drivers license.

2. His cell phone.

3. His Facebook login and password.

4. His car, still running, in the parking lot with his girlfriend in the passenger seat.

5. A flipbook he made of different photos he took of himself during the planning stages including one in front of his house holding a giant map that has a large arrow labeled &#8220;This is where I, Dummy McCokedout of 134 Moron Lane, will rob the armored car.&#8221;
