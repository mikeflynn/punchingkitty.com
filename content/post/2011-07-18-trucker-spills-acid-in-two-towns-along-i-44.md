A tanker truck was rumbling down I-44 Friday night leaking sulfuric acid on to the street which is a problem because it turns out that stuff is bad for you.

> Witness say a tractor trailer was leaking fluids while driving down the highway. Officials were notified, and an officer stopped the vehicle around 7:30p.m.

Obviously, emergency crews had to shut down the highway as well as rush the officer who stopped the truck to the hospital after he got sick from inhaling the fumes (he&#8217;ll be fine). Soon after, authorities released the truck and he continued on his way down I-44 to on Bourbon where we assume everything turned out just fine.

> The tractor trailer that spilled sulfuric acid Friday night on Interstate 44 near Sullivan, Missouri is leaking again – but in a different city.
> 
> Officials say the hazardous mineral was found dripping from the truck Saturday morning at a commuter parking lot in Bourbon, Missouri, forcing nearby residents to evacuate the area.

Oh Sullivan cops, we told you sulfuric acid eats right through duct tape, but you said &#8220;No! This is the good kind, and if it&#8217;s good enough to make my wallet out of it, then it&#8217;s good enough for this tanker.&#8221;&#8230;and then you said &#8220;Yup.&#8221; and we&#8217;re still not sure why.

> Since more reports of a sulfuric acid spill have come through, crews moved the tanker to the Bourbon Industrial Park, where an uncertain amount of the chemical will be unloaded.

&#8230;and then sold throughout the neighborhood since selling stuff kids can smoke or sniff but will obviously kill them is big business out there.
