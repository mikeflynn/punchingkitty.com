Scott Simmons, a 46 year old man from Alton, Illinois has been arrested after &#8220;hundreds of files&#8221; of kiddie p0rn were found on his computer. KMOV didn&#8217;t say how the child pornography was found, but after looking at his mugshot he probably either took it in to a Best Buy to get it fixed and forgot to change his little boy in the Donald Duck outfit wallpaper or simply ran around Alton yelling &#8220;Me likey the kiddies!&#8221;

Why do pervs always either stare creepily forward for their mugshot like the want to molest the camera or look away with a dumb-ass smile like the guys in prison won&#8217;t believe how cool he is when he gets there? Guess what Scotty? We aren&#8217;t sure if you can get Stockholm Syndrome in relation to the broomstick he&#8217;ll be repeated raped with, but Scott might find out after the years of &#8220;research&#8221; he&#8217;ll have to put up with.
