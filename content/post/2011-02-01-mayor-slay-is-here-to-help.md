  Where the hell was this kind of helpful tidbit in November when the city seems to be in the midst of a race against 2009&#8217;s death toll? Oh well&#8230;ok, so if you report those kind of emergencies it makes us look bad (by &#8220;bad&#8221; we mean &#8220;worst than Detroit&#8221;) so just try to use 911 for weather stuff and call&#8230;um&#8230;912 we guess&#8230;for all your &#8220;I&#8217;m got lost going to Crown Candy and people keep shooting at me&#8221; kinda emergencies. Also, if you were to then feel yourself dying, could you try to take a taxi out to St. Charles County? The city will reimburse you and really appreciate it.
