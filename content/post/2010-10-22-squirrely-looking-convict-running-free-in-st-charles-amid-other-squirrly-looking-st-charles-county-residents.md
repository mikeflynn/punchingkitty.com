**_Update_**_: After making all the way to his native Warrenton, MO, his parents urged him to turn in himself, which is what he did Friday._

_Original post follows&#8230;_

Smirky McPimplehead over here somehow managed to escape the dead fish handshake like grip of the St. Louis County police Wednesday night when he jumped out of the transport van in downtown St. Charles.

> Jonathan Banta, 21, of the 5000 block of West Clay Street in St. Charles, jumped out of the van while it was stopped at Fifth Street and Boone&#8217;s Lick Road in St. Charles about 11:30 p.m.
> 
> Rick Eckhard, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said Banta was wanted on a warrant in St. Ann for felony burglary. Police had picked him up from the St. Charles County Jail, he said.

How the hell did he escape from the van?

> Eckhard said he did not know how Banta escaped from the van.

&#8220;To be fair&#8221; Eckhard followed up, &#8220;He did call shotgun right when we exited the jail for transport. Rules are rules.&#8221;

So there you go St. Charles you got this guy running around now. Have fun with that. He&#8217;ll be the crazy looking skinny white guy with ill-advised facial hair. Luckily everyone else without a job running around at all hours, between the ages of 16 and 30 looks just like that in St. Charles. Shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.
