This weekend, all unpaid St. Louis City parking tickets can be cleared by just paying the original ticket price, dropping all overdue fines that can reach as high as 300% per ticket.

> &#8220;We&#8217;ve giving everyone an opportunity to wipe the slate clean,&#8221; Andres Broussard of the City Treasurer&#8217;s office said.
> 
> Drivers interested in the Amnesty program can come to the America&#8217;s Center May 11-12, or the Community Needs Expo. The hours are 9 a.m. &#8211; 5 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. &#8211; 2 p.m. Saturday. Drivers will be presented a voucher. The voucher can be paid online, or in person at the Traffic Violations Bureau downtown. The tickets must be paid before Sunday, May 13, Broussard said.

Lovely idea for the city to get some much needed cash flow going, of course the city is taking the risk of announcing a time and date to a group of people that are clearly not in to following precise guidelines or able to process simple paperwork, so this should go pretty well. Also, parking for this thing on Saturday is going to be horrible downtown, so just pull right up on to the curb anywhere around the America&#8217;s Center&#8230;wait a minute! It&#8217;s a trap!
