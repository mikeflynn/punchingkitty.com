Our friends at Joe Sports Fan have launched a very interesting idea: asking the St. Louis fans to help fund their new all local relaunch and podcast with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattsebek/the-joesportsfan-show" target="_blank">a Kickstarter campaign</a>. The goal is $5,000, and while they&#8217;re off to a good start, we&#8217;d hate to see this brillant idea stall after the glow of the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/deb-peterson/local-sports-and-humor-report-joesportsfan-launches-expansion-campaign/article_d7aeb694-4d21-11e1-ae00-0019bb30f31a.html" target="_blank">Deb Peterson <del>press release</del> article</a> fades.

If you&#8217;ve never heard of Joe Sports Fan, here&#8217;s all you need to know: Occasionally we can&#8217;t help ourselves, but we try very hard to _not_ cover sports stories because the guys over there have St. Louis sports covered. Hopefully that resonates as well as we think it should. That was a difficult statement to make because, you know, we&#8217;re awesome and we know we&#8217;re awesome, but in the case of local sports news we defer to the JSF guys and take the rest of the news (read: crime) for ourselves. They deserve your support, so go throw $30 bucks their way and enjoy what happens next.

Think of it like going to the East Side: It doesn&#8217;t cost much and you have no idea what will come of it, but you&#8217;ll probably laugh and have a good story to tell&#8230;and if it some how gives you a boner, you&#8217;re weird, but good for you!
