Maybe you saw our post yesterday about Kurt Greenbaum, the Post Dispatch&#8217;s Social Media Director and how he got a man fired because he posted a &#8220;vulgarity&#8221; on the comments of an STLToday article.  If not, <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2009/11/19/the-post-dispatchs-social-media-guy-tattles-on-naughty-commenter-craps-on-privacy-policy/" target="_blank">check it out</a>, we go in to in detail there.

In that post, I dropped this little pull quote, suitable for twittering and the like:

> …and then the internet skull-f*cked him.

I was wrong.  The internet populace hadn&#8217;t begun to skull f*ck him at that point.  They are now though.

Midway through yesterday, one of our commenters alerted us that this story had <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a64i6/and_the_big_mildly_nsfw_of_the_day_award_goes_to/" target="_blank">popped up on Reddit</a>, a popular social news site.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2368" title="Screen shot 2009-11-19 at 10.48.09 PM" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.48.09-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-19 at 10.48.09 PM" width="600" height="122" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.48.09-PM.png 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.48.09-PM-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]That&#8217;s kind of where this story took off and turned ugly for Greenbaum.

First, there were comments like this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.50.38-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2369" title="Screen shot 2009-11-19 at 10.50.38 PM" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.50.38-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-19 at 10.50.38 PM" width="587" height="167" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.50.38-PM.png 815w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-19-at-10.50.38-PM-300x85.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8230;and then this (edited):
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kgreenbaum_address.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2370" title="kgreenbaum_address" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kgreenbaum_address.png" alt="kgreenbaum_address" width="540" height="299" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/kgreenbaum_address.png 778w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/11/kgreenbaum_address-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That would be his full name, address, every phone number and email address he has and his boss&#8217; contact info.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8230;and then Twitter took off.  Just <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?ands=&from=&lang=all&near=&nots=&ors=&phrase=&q=&ref=&rpp=15&since=&tag=&to=kgreenbaum&units=mi&until=&within=15" target="_blank">do a quick search for people replying back to Greenbaum via Twitter</a> and calling him a &#8220;pussy&#8221; (thats the word the commenter apparently used).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Oh and of course, you can also now visit: <a href="http://www.KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com/" target="_blank">www.KurtGreenbaumIsAPussy.com</a>

  We aren&#8217;t going to stand here and tell you that all of this is cool, but we also aren&#8217;t going to say its all not funny.  [<em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Address? Not funny. Website?  Totally funny.</em>]
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If there is anything you can take away from this, here it is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  1. Don&#8217;t mess with privacy policies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  2. If you do, don&#8217;t call attention to it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  3. It is amazing how fast people can rally around a story that didn&#8217;t really take off until a day or two after it actually happened.  Kurt may disagree with this right now, but that is a pretty awesome thing about the internet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The good news for Greenbaum, and pretty much the only good news since he is probably getting pizzas sent to his house 24/7, is that internet hatred (or love) is fleeting.  Sadly, though, images can kinda be forever&#8230;.
