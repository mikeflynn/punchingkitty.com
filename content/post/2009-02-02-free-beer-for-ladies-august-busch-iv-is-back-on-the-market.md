St. Louis beer millionaire August Busch IV is back on the market after this divorce from his younger wife of just 2 years.  The worst part, this one slipped right by us.  Which really pisses. me. off.  Damn.  Unlike us, [STLog][1] has been following this story closely. (+1 for them for breaking this one&#8230;.you bastards!)  

> **Busch IV** divorced his wife **Kathryn Lisa Busch** (formerly **Kathryn Thatcher**) on Wednesday in St. Louis County Circuit Court. The couple married just over two years ago. Busch is 44. His ex-wife just 28. 
> 
> I, for one, am glad to hear that Busch IV is back in the field. His carousing skills as a bachelor were legendary and always provided some great second-hand tales. Prior to getting hitched in 2006, Busch IV dated [the pride of Florissant][2]and former Miss USA **Shandi Finnessey**. Much earlier than that, Busch IV dated a woman by the name of **Karla Stratton** &#8212; a dancer at the Sauget topless bar, PT&#8217;s. 

Here are some links from the posts they already have up:

  * [She Was His Wife, But She Wasn&#8217;t his &#8220;Bud&#8221; &#8230; The August Busch IV Divorce Files][4]
  * [Busch IV Wedding Photos][5]

Rest assured we are on the case now!  If any of you see St. Louis&#8217; new playboy out or hear of any past or current tales of his excess or love of tassel-clad ladies email us at **tips[at]punchingkitty.com**
