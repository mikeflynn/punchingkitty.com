February 18th, 2011&#8230;a day that will live in infamy for St. Louis sports. Well, maybe not&#8230;unless you&#8217;re really attached to the Rams&#8217; O.J. Atogwe, the Blue&#8217;s Eric Brewer and the shell of Jim Edmonds. If you are, go get yourself a coke and try to shake it off! Tomorrow will be better&#8230;don&#8217;t look at STLToday&#8217;s Sports home page though. Actually, just turn away right now, because here it is!

Seriously check this crap out: Every single major sports team in St. Louis lost a player through either trade, release, or retirement.

Throw in an extra point for a mention of Pujol&#8217;s eventual leaving and you&#8217;ve got one hell of a sports day!
