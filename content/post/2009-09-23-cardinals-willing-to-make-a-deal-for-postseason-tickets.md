Good news Cardinals fans!  Maybe you didn&#8217;t win the drawing for the chance to buy Cardinal playoff tickets, but like all good crooked business deals, there is a back door!  That&#8217;s right, just grease that outstretched Cardinal wing and all of a sudden the tight grip on 2009 playoff tickets might just loosen a bit.

Here is what you got on your inbox if  you didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the chance to buy tickets and thus are right for the extorting:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1774" title="Screen shot 2009-09-22 at 9.47.29 PM" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-22-at-9.47.29-PM.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2009-09-22 at 9.47.29 PM" width="600" height="413" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-22-at-9.47.29-PM.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-22-at-9.47.29-PM-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]

Yup, for the low low price of 2010 season tickets you can get a chance to buy 2009 playoff tickets.  What a load of crap.  So if a large chunk of the populous doesn&#8217;t go for this &#8220;deal&#8221; are they going to redraw names?  I doubt it.  Hell, with this scheme in place, who says they actually even need to do a drawing, they could just send this out to nearly everyone right?

When asked for a comment, the Cardinals replied:

> Look, do you want to see Matt Holiday next year or not?!  We can&#8217;t always run the season on players paid by the Red Sox!

Ok, fair point.

Plus, think of the Cubs fans&#8230;they don&#8217;t even get the chance to be screwed over by their local beloved franchise this year.

&#8212;

Thanks to our tipster Dave for the heads up!
