That help at all? &#8230;ok, well we&#8217;ve already printed the flyers so we&#8217;re doing this thing anyway.&#8221; &#8211; The St. Louis Rams

After 1,700 submissions the final round of voting has begun with your choices being (hold on to your hat now): **Archie**, **Rammer**, **Rampage**, **Ramsey**, and **Rush**.

Somewhere in St. Louis, Fredbird is shaking his head in disgust.Â You have until Friday the 23rd to go to <a href="http://stlouisrams.com" target="_blank">StLouisRams.com</a> had pick the shiniest turd in that list.

Here, because we know you want to know, 5 better suggestions for the Rams mascot:

**5.** &#8220;Sacked&#8221;

**4.** &#8220;Sheep with horns&#8221;

**3.** &#8220;Sexual Harassment Doll&#8221; &#8212; _Point out on the doll where the other team touched you._

**2.** &#8220;The Safest Uniform for Sam Bradford&#8221;

**1.** &#8220;Power Bottom&#8221;
