In the crowd at last Friday&#8217;s &#8220;Live on the Levee&#8221; Sonic Youth show, we find this little photographic nugget of awesomeness:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" title="sonic-youth-at-the-arch-7-17-09.3637128.36" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sonic-youth-at-the-arch-7-17-09.3637128.36.jpg" alt="sonic-youth-at-the-arch-7-17-09.3637128.36" width="600" height="399" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/sonic-youth-at-the-arch-7-17-09.3637128.36.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/07/sonic-youth-at-the-arch-7-17-09.3637128.36-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]Oh god this is a hot audience!  I know what you are thinking&#8230;for the girls: [Cat Sound], and the fellas: &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJcXleynZs" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve got a boner!</a>&#8220;

I&#8217;m guessing the 4th horseman is getting the beers.

I bet you $40 bucks the little one on the left lives in the middle guy&#8217;s beard.

I feel like there is a Lord of the Rings / Hobbit joke here somewhere, but I&#8217;ve never made it through those movies.

Ok&#8230;ok&#8230;seriously&#8230;seriously&#8230;what are we looking at here?  Ok the one in the middle is definitely a dude.  The bookends though?  I honestly don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m going to say, from left to right: Dude, Dude, Chick.

What are your thoughts?
