The old Admiral Riverboat is being auctioned off and it&#8217;s a damn shame they didn&#8217;t put this bucket up on Ebay a few weeks earlier than they did or we could have tacked in on to our <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/20/6-pretty-much-worthless-ebay-ed-st-louis-items/" target="_blank">list of worthless ebayed St. Louis items</a>.

Ok, so technically it isn&#8217;t &#8220;worthless&#8221; since the &#8220;Buy It Now&#8221; price is a cool 1.5 Million

**1.** Old.

> The SS Admiral was originally built in 1907 as a RR Ferry across the Mississippi.

**2.** Like all South City homes and celebs with daddy issues, it has had some additions, most of it probably being plastic.

> The the 1930&#8217;s it was lengthened 70 ft.

**3.** Air Conditioned!

> &#8230;at that time (1930s) the only air conditioned excursion boat in existence.

**4.** Not going anywhere&#8230;

> It has been a permanently moored entertainment venue on the St. Louis, MO. River Front. The diesel engines and drive were removed approx. 20 years ago.

**5.** Needs a facelift

> For long term use, on water, will require a new skin on the Hull.

Wow, sweet. 1.5 Million dollars sounds like quite a deal if you want to go get yourself the boat version of Diana Ross.

&#8230;the air conditioning would just be a bonus.
