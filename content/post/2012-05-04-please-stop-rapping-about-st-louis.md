Our apologies to Corle 2 Da. <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/09/08/the-worst-music-video-ever-was-shot-in-a-st-louis-condos-kitchen/" target="_blank">His &#8220;So St. Louis&#8221; video</a> is no longer the &#8220;Worst Music Video Ever&#8221;, this big sensory turd known as &#8220;South City&#8221; by the Deuce is now the worst thing we&#8217;ve ever seen. Interesting side note: Deuce also holds the title of lamest, most generic  artist name&#8230;unless they mean &#8220;Deuce&#8221; like &#8220;We&#8217;re going to take a deuce in your ear with our horrible rapping.&#8221; If that&#8217;s the case, it quickly becomes the most clever.

Here&#8217;s the video:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/G72CjARxVGs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

We&#8217;ll give them this: These guys know their St. Louis rap game. They hit all the requirements of mentioning every f*cking street name they drive on, every restaurant they eat at and mentioning the Cardinals 47 thousand times.

What they failed to do was buy a tripod, or a camera other than the one on their flip phone. Here&#8217;s our favorite still that must have happend just after they hit one of those &#8220;So South City potholes&#8221;:

They do eventually get out of the car though. They have to tell us that they are &#8220;so South City they&#8217;re dirty&#8221; 100 times first, but it eventually happens, and when it does get ready for the big set up! Picture this: On the pitcher&#8217;s mound of a public baseball diamond, in a Cardinals jersey, rapping in to a microphone that looks like a weathervane and is plugged in to third base or something. Nevermind, don&#8217;t picture it, just look:

OMG! That is _dirty_!

Here are some selected lyrics:

> &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m so South City. Follow me on Twitter.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Hit Phillips for two cups, and pour some South City love.&#8221; (Yes, they&#8217;re rapping about a national gas station chain.)
> 
> &#8220;I got the whole South City for Shirley&#8221; (We know, but that&#8217;s what it sounds like.)

There&#8217;s more, but we can&#8217;t go on. Hell, this video is so bad this guy tried to open his retro Cardinal jacket and fly right out of it. You&#8217;d think he would have made it without all kinds of pesky talent weighing him down, but alas, he was forced to stay and finish the video.

There&#8217;s something about this city that is interesting enough to make people want to rap about it, but not interesting enough to inspire them to have anything other than a list of locations and businesses and the city name over and over again in the song. It&#8217;s odd, and sad, and then kinda funny, but the one thing it&#8217;s not is &#8220;dirty&#8221;. By that we mean generic rap term white guys use &#8220;dirty&#8221;. It&#8217;s definitely the regular dirty.
