Thanks to the Riverfront Times for <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2011/01/26/thanks-rft-were-the-best-local-celebrity-site/" target="_blank">once again</a> honoring us with a **RFT Web Award**. We even showed up to the award show, making a rare public appearance to meet with the fans and lean on a wall while <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%23rftwebawards%22%20from%3Apunchingkitty&src=typd" target="_blank">tweeting jokes</a> that never did get to show up on the big Twitter wall thing they had. Damn censors.

The show was quite the spectacle. RFT&#8217;s Chad Garrison really took to the role of host (think James Franco at the Oscars) which only turned out to the be pre-show, as the impromptu freaky dance party that followed the awards portion really stole the show, and cost us a few grand in therapy ones those memories un-repress themselves in 10 years.

From <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2013/01/2013_rft_web_awards_winners.php" target="_blank">the RFT&#8217;s article announcing the winners</a>&#8230;

> Nothing is sacred at Punching Kitty. Author Mike Flynn, a 2011 RFT Web Awards winner, calls the site The Daily Show, but for St. Louis. Flynn&#8217;s witty and sarcastic view on St. Louis crime, politics and general happenings kept us laughing, post after post. Only someone with genuine St. Louis pride could know how to make fun of his city so well.

Here&#8217;s the actual award:

  The award wasn&#8217;t labeled, but don&#8217;t worry, we took care of that ourselves.

  Thanks RFT!
