Vincent Newman has been apprehended and charged with at least one of the recent string of violent robberies in South City, and more charges are expected. Just listen to what this dickhead did:

> A 27-year-old woman was shot at 5:55 a.m. Wednesday as she walked to her car in the 1600 block of South Spring Avenue. The man took her purse and shot her in the face, police said.
> 
> A 20-year-old woman was robbed of her cellphone and tablet computer. The robber then shot her in the left arm and left cheek.
> 
> A man, 26, and woman, 30, were robbed about 10 p.m. in the 2200 block of South Grand Boulevard. Police said the gunman approached them, showed a gun and got a purse and cellphone from them before shooting the man in the hand and leg.

What a chicken-shit piece of crap this guy is, and the STLPD wanted this guy bad. Really bad. This morning they released a sketch at a special news conference (top left&#8230;the one that&#8217;s a drawing) and pleaded with the area residents to help them find this guy.

> &#8220;We need (the public) to be our eyes and ears on the street,&#8221; [Lt. Col Lawrence] O&#8217;Toole said.

&#8230;and that&#8217;s just what happened.

> &#8220;People were literally coming out to us in the neighborhood,&#8221; [Sgt. Chris] Stamper said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty diverse area and to have all these people coming out and approaching us spoke of this individual&#8217;s level of concern to them. He was extremely violent and these were in very close proximity and time frame.&#8221;

A great job by the neighborhood that we need to see more of, because face-shooting (Really, the face? <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/06/04/some-guy-got-shot-in-the-face-by-his-apartment/" target="_blank">What is with the face shooting?!</a>) guys like this need to get busted.

As for the sketch&#8230;it&#8217;s not great. Where&#8217;s the facial hair? Dreds aren&#8217;t that big! &#8230;and he&#8217;s not even wearing a hoodie! B &#8211;
