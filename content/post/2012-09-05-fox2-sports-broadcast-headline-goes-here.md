Fox2 got really really close to getting their graphic about the Mets and Cardinals game right. Sure they missed the score, the two lines of notes, and the fact that we&#8217;re talking about baseball teams rather than the NFL, but they did get the names right, and judging by the shot, it did appear on TV.

Lets call it a 4 out of 10.

We don&#8217;t want to be too hard on them though, for all we know they probably just fired the guy that does that for them so now they&#8217;ve got some schmuck like &#8220;friends of the site&#8221; **Charles Jaco** or **Chuckie Marlow** who are back there at the controls in between one Chuck <a href="http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-interview.php" target="_blank">botching <strong>Todd Akin</strong> interviews</a>, and the other holding the camera up in one hand MySpace-style, while he covers local high school football games.

Sure you can find all of this information via some combination of ESPN.com and Facebook, but that&#8217;s not the point of a TV station like this. The point is to fill up as much air time as possible to support the good stuff: Two hours a day of various &#8220;Judge&#8221; shows.
