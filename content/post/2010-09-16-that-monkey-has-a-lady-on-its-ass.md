Who wants two monkeys?! Is it wrong to acquire monkeys simply for the jokes?

Clearly this is one of the many breeds of monkey indigenous to the Missouri wilderness, and not one of those got here on a banana crate and carries some variant of AIDS. One reason to spring the $450 bucks for the monkey would be to say it gave you AIDS instead of that gloryhole at the Phillips 66 on Gravios. That&#8217;s not to say the Phillips 66 gloryhole isn&#8217;t nice. Ever since they taped around the hole perimeter there&#8217;s been much less chafing.
