St. Louis made #3 on a seemingly good list about the <a href="http://travelblog.priceline.com/web/guest/home/-/blogs/priceline-lists-top-50-destinations-for-labor-day-2010;jsessionid=6654E85E801EE839E3B598B05658B075?_33_redirect=/web/guest/home" target="_blank">best places to go for Labor Day</a>! What the hell is happening here? Something feels wrong&#8230;very wrong. We aren&#8217;t the only ones feeling it, right Ghostbusters?

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/O3ZOKDmorj0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Exactly Dr. Venkman! &#8220;Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats&#8230;living together!&#8221; We are St. Louis. We don&#8217;t get on &#8220;good&#8221; lists and we don&#8217;t know how to take this.

On the one hand it&#8217;s great to see St. Louis near the top of a list that doesn&#8217;t start off with &#8220;the worst&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;the most violent&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Biggest Diarrhea-inducing&#8230;&#8221; but on the other hand, this is a pretty lame list to top. &#8220;Top Labor Day Destinations&#8221;? Just saying it makes us want to kick our own ass. Labor Day isn&#8217;t even really about travel, it&#8217;s about BBQ-ing in your own backyard. An actual &#8220;Top Labor Day Destinations&#8221; list should include things like &#8220;Schnucks&#8221; or &#8220;Dirt Cheap&#8221; not &#8220;St. Louis&#8221;. So in some way Priceline is saying &#8220;Here are the top places to go on a weekend where no one ever goes anywhere.&#8221; or in other words &#8220;Don&#8217;t go here.&#8221; &#8230;and there we go!

Now _that&#8217;s_ a list St. Louis is used to! The world has righted itself once again thanks to Punching Kitty! Your neighborhood cats and dogs should start behaving normally any minute now.
