Finally after costing us a tons of penalty yards and being a general douche for pretty much the whole time he was here, the Rams cut Richie Incognito.

Let him have it Coach!  Tell this punk he&#8217;s outa here!

> &#8220;As with all other personnel moves, this is what we felt was in the best interest of the team at this time,&#8221; said Spagnuolo. &#8220;We appreciate Richie&#8217;s efforts and we wish him the very best.&#8221;

God you are such a pussy.  False alarm on the &#8220;finding his balls&#8221; thing!  Our bad!

We appreciate Richie&#8217;s efforts?!  He&#8217;s done nothing but bad-mouth the fans and ruin games in his time here&#8230;but gee, thanks for the memories.  I thought football was a man&#8217;s sport&#8230;oh wait&#8230;maybe that&#8217;s _winning_ football I was thinking of.

What do you have to say Richie?   &#8230;oh and allow us to translate it.

> “Honestly, I’m excited for the new opportunity,” Incognito told the Post-Dispatch.

_What am I suppose to say?  Frankly I can&#8217;t believe I lasted this long._

> “My stay in St. Louis hasn’t been a glorious one from the get-go. I came in with a lot of doubts. It hasn’t been — I’m searching for the word — everything hasn’t been great.&#8221;

The Rams sucked pretty much from the word &#8220;go&#8221; of my career.  I came in with doubts, and now I&#8217;m leaving with more&#8230;and crap loads of money.

> &#8220;So in part, I feel like a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.&#8221;

_They made me take off my pads._

> &#8220;I get an opportunity to go play for a new team in a new city.&#8221;

_The XFL still exists right?_

> &#8220;I can get away from the negativity that has surrounded me, that has been surrounding my entire career here in St. Louis. So that I’m looking forward to.&#8221;

_Do you know how much pot I can buy with my salary?!_

> “At the end of the day it’s a business decision. I’m a professional . . . onward and upward.&#8221;

_I am a giant douche._

> &#8220;I passed along to Spags and Billy. I told them they’re doing a wonderful job.&#8221;

_They had a tough job to live up to following the walking vagina that was Scott Linehan, but keeping me on for nearly the whole season was a great surprise.  Really good job putting up with me. I love money!_

> &#8220;I really do think Spags is doing a great job. It’s obvious what the team needs here &#8230; and it’s talent. It’s not a lack of coaching. And it’s not a lack of desire. It’s just a lack of talent right now. And they’ll get that sorted out.&#8221;

_I just told all my ex-teammates they sucked.  I have to go now._

> &#8220;They’re the right men for the job.”

_I just doomed them._
