Want to show your friends how brave you are? Well come on down to the Loop (No, not the <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/04/02/the-loop-hosted-a-massive-fight-and-a-shooting-saturday-night/" target="_blank">&#8220;shooty&#8221; side of The Loop</a>, the _other_ side!) and hang with ex-Ram, current Drew Brees fan club president and friend of the site Kyle Turley.

Here&#8217;s the scoop from <a href="http://www.gridironrecords.com/kyle-turley-blueberry-hill-in-st-louis-mo-on-46/" target="_blank">Gridiron Records</a>:

> Kyle makes his return to St. Louis after opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd at The Family Arena last June.  Kyle will be sharing the stage with Nashville buddy, <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/heathforbes" target="_blank">Heath Forbes</a>.  Come see them rock the Duck Room before they head to Columbia, MO, on Saturday and open for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/210490322375170/" target="_blank">David Allan Coe</a>.

Doors are at 8p in the Blueberry Hill Duck Room, show starts at 9p ($10 cover). You&#8217;re assured some good music by a nice guy and there might even be a Punching Kitty sticker in it for you! &#8230;maybe if you put enough stickers on your chest, you&#8217;ll be bullet-proof! (No, you won&#8217;t.)

If you talk to Kyle, make sure to tell him how much you love NFL bounty systems. He just loves <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KyleTurley/status/187898061979258881" target="_blank">friendly chat</a> about that kinda stuff and in no way will he tell you that he believes your IQ is lower than average. &#8230;also if you&#8217;re going to do this wait for us to get there first.

While you kill time at work waiting for the show, here&#8217;s some links to our previous adventures with the former Ram:
