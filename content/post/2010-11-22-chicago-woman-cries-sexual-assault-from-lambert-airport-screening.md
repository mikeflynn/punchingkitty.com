The TSA staff on duty gave her two choices: Stay in St. Louis (and probably get shot or robbed) or take part in the new &#8220;invasive&#8221; pat down.

> Her gloved hands touched my breasts&#8230;went between them.

Woah.

> Then she went into the top of my slacks,

Mmmm. Ok, ok. Slow down now, there&#8217;s no need to rush.

> &#8230;inserted her hands between my underwear and my skin

Nice. Nice. \*pours a glass of wine\* Go on.

> &#8230;then put her hands up on outside of slacks, and patted my genitals.

Weird ending, but nice. Was it good for you Penny?

> “I was shaking and crying when I left that room” Moroney says.  “Under any other circumstance, if a person touched me like that without my permission, it would be considered criminal sexual assault.”

It&#8217;s ok, we always cry at the end too. We&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s normal.

When asked for a comment the TSA said &#8220;Security is our priority and besides, it&#8217;s her fault for having a fake knee, wanting to fly and probably being a terrorist that keeps bombs between her boobs. You&#8217;ve won this round Penny, but one of these times we&#8217;ll pat your snizz and find the bomb you put there. What then?&#8221;

Ok, that was a fake comment, but it out of all the joke comments we&#8217;ve done it easily had the best chance of being real with these TSA nuts.
