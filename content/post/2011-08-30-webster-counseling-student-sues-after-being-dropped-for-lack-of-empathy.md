Guess which one you can&#8217;t buy?

> A former Webster University student who was studying to be a family counselor says in a lawsuit that he was dismissed from a master&#8217;s degree program after it was determined that he lacked empathy.
> 
> The suit, which claims up to $1 million in losses and seeks at least $2 million in punitive damages, alleges the school dismissed him quickly rather than help him improve his empathy to complete the field work required for graduating.

So a school, Webster University, has decided to kick a student out after little warning because of one item on the checklist after he passed all others&#8230;and they&#8217;re saying he&#8217;s the one without empathy?

> The student, David Schwartz, 44, of University City, had received all A&#8217;s and only one C in his course work, according to a school transcript. But he was dismissed from the program on March 14 after he received a &#8220;no credit&#8221; for failing to successfully complete the practicum, in which he was to apply his class work to a real-world counseling setting.

That does seem kinda weird. Any other reason you could see why you&#8217;d be booted so quickly?

> Schwartz alleges in his lawsuit that he was deemed a poor performer after he wrote an anonymous letter to the dean criticizing a professor&#8217;s teaching methods and noting the romantic relationship between that professor and an administrator.

Ah, well there you go! It wasn&#8217;t a lack of empathy for your patients, but _empathy for your teacher_! A teacher who really just wanted to be a little lazy in the classroom and to bone that administrator. How could you not have empathy for that?! Dick. That&#8217;s obviously your problem. Just think of people that want to be lazy and bang others, all while at work! I think we can all be more empathetic for them.

Yup, that&#8217;s definitely it&#8230;and his last semester counseling term paper entitled &#8220;Cry About It More Bitch: A Study In Why I Don&#8217;t Give A Shit Where Your Daddy Touched You or Why It Makes You Want to Burn Things; If Anyone&#8217;s Touching Anyone, It Should Be Your Mom Touching Me (On My Penis)&#8221; had a thing or two to do with the decision.

Damn college papers and their long titles.
