Unemployed Dallas Cowboys quarterback **Tony Romo** has drug the pineapple through quite a number of ladies. First he got <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jessica+simpson&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1130&bih=725" target="_blank">Jessica Simpson</a> on her way down from being hot and famous, then he snagged <a href="http://www.google.com/search?um=1&hl=en&biw=1130&bih=725&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=carrie+underwood&aq=0&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=carrie+under" target="_blank">Carrie Underwood</a> on the way up, but now he&#8217;s decided the only goal line he wants to eternally scramble for belongs to is former 2008 Miss Missouri and Mizzou alum, **Candice Crawford**. (Here&#8217;s hoping we are the first site to make a football metaphor for her vagina! \*fingers crossed\*)

You might be interested in to what amazing journalism a Mizzoui grad working in the bustling Texas local news scene does&#8230;

> Crawford, a former beauty queen, was Miss Missouri USA in 2008. The University of Missouri grad worked as a local news reporter in Texas and now co-hosts &#8220;The RC Project&#8221; with Roni Proter, a Dallas news show forecasting fashion trends.

Stay in school kids! &#8230;unless you&#8217;re pretty and then you can call any old stupid ass thing a job and then marry a rich athlete.

Candice also happens to be the kid sister of Gossip Girl star Chase Crawford _[Editor&#8217;s Note: No idea who that Chase guy is, but I want to nail his sister.]_, enjoyed a wedding at Arlington Hall with 600 of her closest friends and family.

> Romo and Crawford&#8217;s out of town guests were provided with a welcoming gift bag orchestrated by celebrity party planner Todd Fiscus of Todd Events. Fiscus told Us the custom-made bag, bearing the couple&#8217;s initials, was filled with luxury treats including a Neiman Marcus gift card, assorted cookies, a mini-bottle of Champagne, chocolates, gourmet popcorn and Kiehl&#8217;s beauty products.

Nothing says &#8220;Texas Luxury&#8221; like assorted cookies.

Think about that Mizzou grads, amongst you was a future beauty queen that married a NFL quarterback and has a famous actor for a brother. All three recently spent a weekend looking fabulous, eating fancy assorted cookies. &#8230;oh we think we just heard your Easy Mac ding. Try not to dribble it up on your sweatshirt this time.
