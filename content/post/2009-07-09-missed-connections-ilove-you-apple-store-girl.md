I&#8217;m not going to pretend to know the intricacies of the mind of cute girls, but you aren&#8217;t really selling yourself here man.  &#8220;I&#8217;m a Mac geek&#8221;, &#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m also a total dork&#8221;. &#8220;just to try to work up the balls&#8221;? Dude.

Maybe you&#8217;re right though.  What are the odds a cute girl working at the Apple Store would ever run across a dorky Apple fanatic, with little to no self-esteem?  She probably never sees, or has to interact all. the. time. with unique guys like you.

Good luck with this &#8220;Windows Vista&#8221;-like plan.  It totally can&#8217;t crash and burn and have millions decry how horrible it was.
