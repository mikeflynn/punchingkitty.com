Everyone knows and loves perusing Craigslist&#8217;s Missed Connections section, and while we don&#8217;t like to make a habit of it, we&#8217;re no different. It&#8217;s amazing how entertaining it is to read people&#8217;s desperate attempts to get a hold of someone that they met in a chance connection like checking out at a Schnucks or grabbing a bite to eat at a local White Castle. It&#8217;s also amazing how many people don&#8217;t seem to fully understand the intent of &#8220;Missed Connections&#8221;. Specifically, the _missed_ part. Take for example this gentleman who wants to <a href="http://stlouis.craigslist.org/mis/3171240134.html" target="_blank">reconnect with the guy that blew him last week</a>:

  There&#8217;s lots of ways to describe this connection, but &#8220;missed&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of them. You&#8217;d think you&#8217;d at least trade Facebook information sometime around the time his nose connected with your pubes. We do love the one detail he did remember: &#8220;I think you drove a Honda.&#8221; Good luck buddy! We&#8217;d hate to see a great relationship like this never get the chance to blossom. Can&#8217;t wait the &#8220;How&#8217;d you two meet?!&#8221; story!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then there&#8217;s this guy who&#8217;s post is like a mystery wrapped in an enigma, <a href="http://stlouis.craigslist.org/mis/3151793131.html" target="_blank">then shoved up a butt</a>. The only thing we do know for sure, is that this isn&#8217;t a Missed Connection:

  This is a man looking for a woman, and the title is (emphasis ours): &#8220;the sun will shin <em>in</em> <strong>my</strong> back door someday&#8230;&#8221; &#8230;ummm. What? Again, it sounds like these two crazy kids connected at some point, so it&#8217;s hardly a missed connection, but it is a connection we wish we missed. What is he looking for here? He wants sun to shine in <em>his</em> &#8220;back door&#8221;, but the location of the post is &#8220;up your butt&#8221; implying <em>her</em> butt. It&#8217;s almost as confusing as it is disturbing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Almost.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Actually it&#8217;s not that close.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Isn&#8217;t there anyone in St. Louis looking for someone in a true, and not entirely crazy, missed connection?!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Close enough.
