[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1820" title="jamestown_mall" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/jamestown_mall.jpg" alt="jamestown_mall" width="600" height="325" srcset="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/jamestown_mall.jpg 600w, http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/09/jamestown_mall-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />][1]On Friday a panel of experts on crappy malls or something recommended that Jamestown Mall should be bulldozed and use the space for a &#8220;town center&#8221; with retail shops and restaurants, which to us, sounds like a mall without a roof&#8230;or a strip mall.   Good idea.

> The panel is currently calling their concept for the new development &#8220;Lindbergh Place&#8221; a mixed use town center complete with everything from shops and restaurants to YMCA&#8217;s and parks.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />At this point the Planning Director Donna Lewis says the mall property is so outdated that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to even reuse the current structures. She said the best option would be to simply level the mall and start over.

Jamestown Mall is certainly a piece of crap.  There&#8217;s no doubt about that, but maybe there&#8217;s more to be saved here!  I just took a look at their store directory and they have a Victoria&#8217;s Secret, a Macy&#8217;s&#8230;hmm&#8230;a&#8230;uh&#8230;number of kiosks celling weaves, cell phone cases and cheesy ties I&#8217;m assuming&#8230;oh and they have a &#8220;Low Blow Video & Photography&#8221; [Editor&#8217;s Note: [Seriously][2].]

Ah hell you&#8217;re right, shut it down.  Don&#8217;t blow it up and do a strip mall though, just leave it there empty a let someone put in a haunted house in it for a month so someone can advertise on The Point.  The rest of the time let bums sleep in it and do drugs&#8230;which is basically a North County community center!
