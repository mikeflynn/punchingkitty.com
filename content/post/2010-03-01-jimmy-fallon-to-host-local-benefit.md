Do people laughing at their own jokes and saying &#8220;um&#8221; a lot make you want to give your money away? Great! Because Bob Costas is going to have Jimmy Fallon host his benefit at the Fox Theatre on April 17th.

<a href="http://interact.stltoday.com/blogzone/deb-petersons-breaking-schmooze/uncategorized/2010/02/jimmy-fallon-named-to-host-bob-costas-event-for-cardinal-glennon-childrens-medical-center/" target="_blank">Deb Peterson of the Post Dispatch</a> took the time to copy this paragraph about Fallon out of the press release:

> Fallon is a Saturday Night Live alumni with a versatile comedic style that has enabled him to be involved in a diverse line-up of television and film projects. He currently hosts Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, which airs locally at 11:35 on KSDK-TV (Channel 5).

In addition to the talents listed above, his farts sound like giggles and smell likeÂ cinnamon.
