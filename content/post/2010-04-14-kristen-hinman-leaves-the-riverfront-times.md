Also, Kristen Hinman is leaving the Riverfront Times.

Hinman, who has been at the RFT for over five years, has been the fingers at the keyboard for some of their more memorable posts in recent years including the recent piece on fan-of-the-site <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2010-02-24/news/dana-loesch-cofounder-st-louis-tea-party-conservative-talk-radio-host" target="_blank">Dana Loesch</a> and, one of our favorites, a article entitled: _<a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-08-27/news/kevin-slaten-s-head-is-about-to-explode-the-exiled-sports-talk-radio-ranter-needs-to-get-some-things-off-his-chest/" target="_blank">Kevin Slaten&#8217;s Head Is About to Explode: The exiled sports-talk radio ranter needs to get some things off his chest</a>_.

Undoubtedly, Himnan&#8217;s thrill of her RFT writing career was interviewing, Mike Flynn, editor of this very site, not once, but twice, for our feature in the <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2010-03-03/news/a-bloggers-bakers-dozen-rft-staff-sampler-st-louis-must-read-blogosphere" target="_blank">Blogger&#8217;s Dozen</a> and a little while ago for the <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-09-17/news/unreal-remains-on-the-prowl-for-cougars-sees-some-men-about-a-dog-and-checks-in-with-an-endangered-virgin" target="_blank">Tour de Frankfurter</a>.

We hear Hinman is off to Washington D.C. where the cost of living is way higher, but we hear there is less poop on the side walks. Sounds nice. Of course we will miss her voice in our weekly jaunt to read words printed on a dead tree.

Kristen, if you would feel like starting the Washington D.C. franchise of Punching Kitty, lets talk!
