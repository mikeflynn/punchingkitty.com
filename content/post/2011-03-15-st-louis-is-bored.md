It&#8217;s boring here. Sure Japan&#8217;s got some stuff going on and Libya&#8217;s all busy with their own stuff, but St. Louis is far away from all of that and it&#8217;s boring here. Just look at this <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?geocode=38.627522%2C-90.19841%2C50.0mi&max_id=47524824830058496&page=1&q=+near%3A%22st.+louis%2C+mo%22+within%3A50mi+%23bored&rpp=20" target="_blank">Twitter search for &#8220;#bored&#8221;</a>:

<a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/crime/article/249376/147/Man-charged-with-murdering-2-year-old-boy" target="_blank">Donye Calvin killed a baby</a> &#8212; Totally boring. Anyone can kill a baby. Hit us up after you kill a bear or mountain lion or something.

<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/03/14/delta-goofs-airline-runs-low-on-de-icer-thousands-stranded-at-lambert/" target="_blank">Delta Airlines wasn&#8217;t prepared for yesterday&#8217;s snow</a> &#8212; Oh you weren&#8217;t prepared for all the snow? Just fix it and don&#8217;t be a dick to your customers. Boring!

When did St. Louis turn in to &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/" target="_blank">The Town</a>&#8220;? Which was a good movie, but since these guys didn&#8217;t rob the bank in nun costumes, it&#8217;s pretty boring.

&#8230;booorrriinnng!
