Recently University City&#8217;s State Senator Joan Bray proposed legislation that would charge any non-St. Louis County residents for admission.

Well the Zoo was all like &#8220;Whateva!&#8221; and released the following statement:

> &#8220;The St. Louis Zoo does not intend to charge admission. We are committed to remaining free to all, including non-residents of St. Louis and St. Louis County, consistent with the language of the original legislation. We are not aware of the impetus behind the recent Missouri Senate amendment, but we are not in support of it as it pertains to the St. Louis Zoo.&#8221;

The Zoo closed it&#8217;s statement with: &#8220;Also, we at the Zoo hope that nothing tragic happens to Senator Bray any time soon, like seeing your driveway covered in elephant crap or running in to a lion in her garage.&#8221;
