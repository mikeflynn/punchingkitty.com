After an audit of Missouri&#8217;s sex offenders database, it was found that 7 percent of convicted pervs hadn&#8217;t registered despite the legal mandate.

> Montee released her audit of the sex offender registration program Wednesday. Generally, it found improvement from a review eight years ago. But the audit said Missouri &#8212; like most states &#8212; has not yet complied with federal sex offender requirements. Missouri&#8217;s deadline is July 2011.

7 percent is probably a lot more people than you would think, guess and hope. Statistically, at least a few of you reading this should probably get on the stick! &#8230;wait. No. We meant register. We didn&#8217;t mean anything else you thought that meant.

7 percent is not that much though when you realize how little it takes to get on this list however. We threw some zipcodes at STLToday&#8217;s commenter registration form&#8230;er, we mean <a href="http://more.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/infozone.nsf/story/0797780b585b75e5862573e500709263?OpenDocument" target="_blank">sex offender search engine</a> and found that there are lots and lots of really f-ed up shiz going down around us, there is also some questionable listings (at least form the data they share with us).

That&#8217;s all it takes? How many park trees have to report a homeless guy for him to make the sex offender&#8217;s list? Also, its been noted that he has not registered. Maybe because he&#8217;s homeless. Not sure.

Also of note is that the guy right below him on the list&#8217;s last name is Finger, making that the best name for a sex offender ever.
