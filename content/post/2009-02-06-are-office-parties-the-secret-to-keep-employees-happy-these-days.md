When the economy is rough, raises stop, trips get canceled, bonuses are clamped and those types of things generally make the average worker sad.  So what&#8217;s a company do to?  From what we hear, many in St. Louis are turning to cheap office &#8220;parties&#8221;.

Step 1: Think of reason for party.

Step 2: Buy some food.

Step 4: Happy employees

Step 5: Profit!

We aren&#8217;t sure how well this works, but for the record, its better than not having free lunch.  I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m so happy I&#8217;ve forgotten about the other things that have been dropped from the Company Perk Menu, but eh&#8230;better than not having a job, although a bit ironic that the ones that still have jobs get free food.

Are _you_ fooled by the cheese plate and cold cuts?
