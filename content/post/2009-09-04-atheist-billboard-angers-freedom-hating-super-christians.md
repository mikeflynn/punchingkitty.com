> &#8220;We&#8217;d like to invite everyone to imagine a world free from religious wars, sectarian strife, and superstition,&#8221; said Annie Laurie Gaylor, Foundation co-president.

> &#8220;Like John Lennon, I&#8217;ve found that nature and reality are enough for me. I also like to imagine no hell below us, above us only sky. The only afterlife that should concern us is a secure and pleasant future for our descendants,&#8221; said Dan Barker.

Shockingly, this is pissing off people, I but I can&#8217;t figure out why.  Its a damn billboard.  Its not doing anything.  Its not making you an atheist any more than those Cracker Barrel billboards make you want to go eat a stack of crappy pancakes in a wood-paneled room that smells like B.O. flavored syrup.

Sadly, I guarantee that we haven&#8217;t heard the last of this.  There are just too many old intolerant people with too much time in this city.
