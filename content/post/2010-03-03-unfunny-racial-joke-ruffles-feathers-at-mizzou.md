<a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/mar/02/mizzou-racial-incident-under-investigation/" target="_blank">The Globe Democrat is reporting</a> on a &#8220;prank&#8221; that is giving everyone fits at Mizzou:

> University of Missouri Columbia students spoke out at a Town Hall meeting Monday night after an incident at the Black Culture Center early Friday morning where someone left cotton balls on the ground in front of the building.

Oh I get it.  Because all the black kids that go to Mizzou were slaves not long ago and picked cotton!  &#8230;oh wait. Half these kids probably didn&#8217;t even get the lame joke until someone explained it to them.  Nothing is funnier than a joke that needs explanation or references events from over 100 years ago.  Hilarious.  Sure this is offensive, but its more offensive that someone thought this was going to play on some level.  This is like telling industrial revolution jokes.

> University of Missouri, Columbia Police tell Globe-Democrat.com that they are investigating but at this point have no arrests.

Wait what?  We covered how this was offensive in multiple ways, but last I checked there is nothing illegal with what was done here.  We let hicks tell two guys they don&#8217;t know that they can&#8217;t get married for god sakes.  Dumb? Yup. But that&#8217;s how it works. This is America and we let people do all kinds of offensive and uncool shit all the time, which the founding fathers wanted to do because we assume George Washington was into all kinds of freaky, messed up stuff.

I don&#8217;t think civil rights are going to come in to play here because I&#8217;m not exactly confident that the Mizzou authorities are going to track down the un-funny perps:

> Police said although there is no surveillance video directly in front of the center, they are reviewing other surveillance video searching for anyone carrying large amounts of cotton balls. Investigators are also working with local stores looking into recent purchases of large amounts of cotton balls.

Good thinking Serpico.  While you&#8217;re looking in to that, I&#8217;m going to go check in to the kid that recently made this for her mom:

No doubt her or her teacher were involved.
