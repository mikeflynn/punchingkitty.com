&#8220;What do you know!&#8221; said one officer, &#8220;You know, you pull over hispanic after hispanic and you have to let them go because they weren&#8217;t doing anything wrong or that trailer full of lawn mowers and hedge clippers really did belong to them and then something like this happens.  It just really makes your day!&#8221;

> Around 6:30 p.m. Sunday, the Phelps County Sheriff’s Department said a Peterbuilt tractor trailer was stopped for a traffic violation.
> 
> During the course of the traffic stop, deputies became suspicious because of conflicting information and called in a K-9 trained in the detection of illegal narcotics. When the K-9 alerted on the tractor portion of the vehicle a search was conducted and 130 pounds of cocaine were found hidden in different locations of the vehicle.

The conflicting information they are referring to was that one of the &#8220;mexicans&#8221; in the car said that they were originally from Chile which immediately made them suspicious since they were _obviously_ mexicans and &#8220;Chili&#8221; totally sounded made up.
