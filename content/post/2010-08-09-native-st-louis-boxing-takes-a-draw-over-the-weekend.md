Both were expected to win.

1 out of 2 ain&#8217;t bad though right. Unless it&#8217;s a homework grade, then it&#8217;s a big fat fail. School is hard.

Cory &#8220;The Next Generation&#8221; Spinks fought first in one of the 116 undercards. He got punched 44 times in the face and then the ref stopped the fight.

> &#8220;The referee stopped the fight, but I don&#8217;t know why,&#8221; Spinks said. &#8220;I totally disagreed. He didn&#8217;t even hit me and I lost my title.&#8221;

Apparently punch #44 was a dozy because you got hit lots of times Cory. Sounds like maybe the ref didn&#8217;t want to be Rocky in Rocky IV and stop the fight right before that bigger guy killed you.

> &#8220;He had a staggered and dazed look,&#8221; Nelson said of Spinks. &#8220;He shook his head. At the count of eight, he stepped backwards, and I decided that I didn&#8217;t want his opponent to hit him again in that condition.&#8221;

He is right about losing his title though. There goes that _Cory Spinks: Punch Out_ game we were hoping for.

Later in the night Devon Alexander won and saved the night for St. Louis boxing.

> Devon Alexander, the boxing pride of St. Louis, hung onto his World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation 140-pound titles Saturday night with a victory over challenger Andriy Kotelnik.

It wasn&#8217;t exactly a dominant win, but that&#8217;s ok. We&#8217;ll take it. The other guy thinks he won though, so that&#8217;s kinda awkward.

> &#8220;I want the belt &#8230; I deserve it,&#8221; said Kotelnik, who earned $250,000. &#8220;If the fight were anywhere else but here, I would be champion. I&#8217;m speechless; I have no words to describe what happened. That guy has something that belongs to me.&#8221;

Way to go out like a bitch dude. Maybe if you weren&#8217;t such a pussy and spent a little extra time training rather than working on your &#8220;I was robbed&#8221; press release you might have one&#8230;but you lost. So maybe the best move right now is to go home and try to get that sand out of your vagina.

That&#8217;s right, I called you out Mary! Come to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=+St+Louis+Post-Dispatch&sll=38.63293,-90.206337&sspn=0.023936,0.041113&ie=UTF8&hq=St+Louis+Post-Dispatch&hnear=&ll=38.633467,-90.194492&spn=0.024774,0.041113&z=15" target="_blank">Post Dispatch offices</a> and make me shut up&#8230;dare you bitch!

Sincerely,

The guy [who drew this and ripped off this very site][1] (Who is also a little bitch.)
