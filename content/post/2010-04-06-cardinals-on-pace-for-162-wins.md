After <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=300405117" target="_blank">beating the Reds</a> today 11 to 6, they are on pace for an astounding 162 wins! Which should be just enough to win the central division. \*fingers crossed\*

Not only that but&#8230;

Albert Pujols, with his two homeruns, is on pace for about 324 home runs.

Yadier Molina is on pace for only 162, but all of them are grand slams.

Chris Carpenter is on pace for 30-something wins and actually, only 90-something strikeouts.

Sadly though, Skip Schumaker is on pace to not get a single hit all season.
