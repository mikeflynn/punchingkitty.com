> Tuesday, the department will unveil a new vehicle it&#8217;s calling &#8216;The Exterminator.&#8217;
> 
> It&#8217;s a refurbished armored truck that&#8217;s equipped with video cameras, digital recorders and live video streaming computers.

Yes, it totally sounds like the St. Clair Police Department are getting in to the &#8220;Bang Bus&#8221; porno game, but sadly that&#8217;s not the plan&#8230;

> &#8216;The Exterminator&#8217; will be parked in front of suspects&#8217; homes and video from the four cameras is streamed live to computers at the Sheriff’s Department. Investigators can even see live video on their smart phones.

This party wagon isn&#8217;t supposed to undercover, but just the opposite, letting the perp know that we know that he knows we&#8217;re watching. If you&#8217;re interested you can checkout the 20-ton Flip camera at <a href="http://www.theexterminator.us/" target="_blank">theexterminator.us</a>, and even watch <a href="http://www.theexterminator.us/" target="_blank">a feed from the front-mounted camera</a>. What? The perp we&#8217;re &#8220;exterminating&#8221; just stabbed a guy and sold crack to a 5-year-old _behind_ his house? Damn. He&#8217;s found the &#8220;The Exterminator&#8217;s&#8221; one true weakness!

Is this really what local police have resorted to? The old &#8220;We&#8217;re not touching you! We&#8217;re not touching you!&#8221; play? This is the best we have now? If this doesn&#8217;t work, will we be moving to the crime-trashing &#8220;Wet Willie&#8221; plan?

Oh hold on, we have to help this nice gentleman with a gun carry out my TV to his shitty pickup truck. Here&#8217;s hoping he rapes me too. It&#8217;s nice to at least feel attractive.
