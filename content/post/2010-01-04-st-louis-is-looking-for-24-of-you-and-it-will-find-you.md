According to the <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/jan/02/number-murders-drop-st-louis-2008/" target="_blank">Globe-Democrat</a>, managed to kill 24 less people in 2009 than in 2008.

> The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department reported there were 143 homicides recorded in the city for 2009. That&#8217;s 24 fewer than the 167 homicides reported in the city during 2008. Police departments record crimes such as homicides that become part of the FBI&#8217;s Uniform Crime statistics

24 of you got away&#8230;and St. Louis pissed.

You think you&#8217;re going to get away with this?  Pffft.  Maybe in Salt Lake City, but not here.  Not in one of America&#8217;s most dangerous cities.   24 people cheated death in St. Louis last year and St. Louis hates cheaters!

Ha ha ha&#8230;another funny article from Punching Kitty!  Well laugh it up buddy.  You just wait until 2010 ends with exactly 24 more deaths than in 2009.
