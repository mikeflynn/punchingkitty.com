When you rob someone, don&#8217;t just pull the gun out, surprise them and then think it&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s not! Robbery not finished yet! You still have work to do! Just don&#8217;t put down the gun!

> The suspected robber, whose name has not been released, came to the home on Compton to use the phone, police said. He came there with a 20-year-old man he&#8217;d just met on Wednesday night. Inside the home on Compton was a 19-year-old man.

> Once inside the home, the suspect pulled out a gun to rob the others, police said. When he put the gun down, the 19-year-old man was able to get the gun and shoot the would-be robber.

So see right there was the problem. Don&#8217;t put down the gun, because then they have the gun. This may have worked if you, the robber, had 2 or 3 guns, but you&#8217;re robbing people so that&#8217;s probably a stretch.

The victims turned awesome action heroes are cooperating with police and have the best Facebook wall posts in all of St. Louis.
