Yes it&#8217;s a little old, but St. Louisan and star of AMC&#8217;s popular show Mad Men, John Hamm, appeared on one of our favorite web shows: _Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis_

&#8220;The women in the show sure are very pretty.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, very much so.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you ever get around to fingering any of them?&#8221;

&#8220;Do you mean like identifying them in a line-up?&#8221;
