Ann Rubin of KSDK lost her shiz just a little bit last night on the news when a fender bender happened behind her, just off camera. She made a little gasp, finished her sentence and then explained the situation before throwing it back to Kay Quinn who didn&#8217;t even ask if everyone was alright&#8230;what the hell Kay?! Everyone died. Are you happy now you didn&#8217;t wasted the time to ask? Feel good about yourself?!

&#8230;ok, they didn&#8217;t die&#8230;or maybe they did&#8230;we don&#8217;t know. It didn&#8217;t happen to us, and as such, it might have well have happened on the moon or in Chesterfield. Two places we never seem to make it to, but we&#8217;re pretty sure both have a Chick Fil A. We don&#8217;t care, but we feel like Kay Quinn should. Hell if Kay was there and gave a damn, she might have been able to use her jaw to chisel away the door to get the people out.
