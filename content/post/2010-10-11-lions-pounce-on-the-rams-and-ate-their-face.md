The Lions bent over the Rams and just went to town, causing Detroit wide receiver Nate Burleson to have to take a break from banging us because he balls were apparently on fire (above).

So much for all that &#8220;We might make the playoffs!&#8221; talk from last week huh? \*cough\*<a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/10/04/the-rams-won-again-everyone-just-be-cool/" target="_blank">Told ya so.</a>\*cough\*

Even pre-blessed, Hall of Fame Quarterback Sam Bradford looked a bit lost out there, especially after losing go-to receiver Mark Clayon to injury. Bradford did have strong words about the teams play after the game though:

> &#8220;There are going to be a lot of things that we have to find on the film and fix because we have to make sure this never happens again,&#8221; said Bradford, who was drafted this year No. 1 overall just ahead of Suh. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been part of a loss like this.&#8221;

We&#8217;re confused now. Do we suck horribly again or is this going to be called just a &#8220;blip&#8221; or a &#8220;growing pain&#8221; by the local radio cheerleaders? This is all so confusing! We could have sworn the Rams were the best team in the division last week. Man we hope D&#8217;Marco Farr can help us out by explaining all of this while mixing in a few football-isms and telling us which players are &#8220;his boy&#8221;. Always helpful.

For those that missed the game or haven&#8217;t seen the full highlights we have one linked below courtesy of NFL Films:

At least the Rams/Goats proved to be at least difficult enough to chew as to allow those villagers to escape.
