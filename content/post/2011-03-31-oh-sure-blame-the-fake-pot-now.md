Yup, fake pot. Had to have been the fake pot. Oh and let us guess, he ran in to the church to get help right?

> Police said [Dustin W. Ostmann] told them he had smoked a sythetic marijuana called &#8220;Knock Out.&#8221; They said frightening hallucinations led him randomly to the church to seek help. Once there, though, he ran screaming through the halls, pushed down a 14-year old, threw a table at a 71-year-old and assaulted a 61-year-old, police said. They said the final assault victim restrained Ostmann.

&#8230;bingo!

So lets get this straight, Dusty here lit up the fake &#8220;Knock Out&#8221; pot, started trippin&#8217; balls, and so he hopped in the car and drove to the local church for help. Not to the hospital, or a friend&#8217;s house, or a just not driving anywhere and just waiting out the &#8220;Knock Out&#8221;&#8230;a freaking church. What was the church going to do? Was Dustin hoping for a medieval church possibly? Did he assume one of the old folks he knocked down was going to have some leaches on them?

Seriously though, that fake pot sounds like a great time. Nothing like lighting up a pouch full of god knows what only toÂ hallucinate, hope in our car and somehow not kill yourself just long enough to end up in a church with a 61 year old man on top of you. Priests are going to by this stuff in droves! &#8220;Knock Out brownies in the rectory! Free for all alter boys!&#8221;
