Lets be clear. We don&#8217;t want to mislead anyone. This is the best &#8220;chick&#8221; fight we&#8217;ve seen in a while. &#8220;Chick&#8221; fights consists of 2+ attractive girls that probably really aren&#8217;t fighting as much as they are just wrestling to get people&#8217;s attention. They do this because it works. Chick Fights are awesome.

This video below (use headphones) is a &#8220;crazy bitch&#8221; fight.  One of the combatants is tall and lanky, the other is short and fat with pink hair that gets ripped off and both are really really pissed off. Also a gun is involved for a short time and then they go back to ripping each others shirts off, which would have been cool, had this been a &#8220;chick&#8221; fight.

Our favorites parts were the guy that tries to break up the fight like 3 times and each time just ends up walking away looking freaked out and the fact that this video had the most epic car on video since the General Lee. I dub thee Sargent _Murphy_ Lee.

Anyone know where this place is in St. Louis? It looks like a place a mile east on Delmar from the loop, but I can&#8217;t tell. There are way too many weaves and boobs I don&#8217;t want to see in the way of the scenery.
