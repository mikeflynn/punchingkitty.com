The fun never stops over at the St. Louis corner of everyone&#8217;s favorite hooker directory, Craigslist.  We start off the week with two interesting Missed Connections.  The common thread?  Fellas demonstrating some interesting techniques with the ladies&#8230;

> **Mekong, 3am, I pushed you off the booth &#8211; m4w (Mekong)**
> 
> I just wanted to say &#8220;that I am so sorry&#8221;. I didnt mean to push you off the booth last night. I felt like such an ass. I totally deserved it when you punched me in the face. Once again. Sorry. [[Source][1]]

Kinda wish he would elaborate as to what happened up to the point where he pushed a girl off a booth in such a vicious way that he deserved and _punch_ in the face&#8230;

That was a good one, but this one is really the best of Craiglist: Weird, odd location, even odder title, and a strong sense of entitlement&#8230;

> **Do I have a chewing problem? First Watch &#8211; m4w &#8211; 32 (in orbit)**
> 
> You are the most beautiful girl in the world. I am going to marry you. [[Source][2]]

Are we to assume that some woman came up to him and asked him if he had a &#8220;chewing problem&#8221; (which you know had to be gross&#8230;I mean what &#8220;chewing problem&#8221; can you think of that doesn&#8217;t involve seeing chewed food in some form or fashion) and because of that interaction, this dude is making it his life&#8217;s work to marry her&#8230;and girl that by all assumed measure thinks he is gross.  Yes.  I believe thats it.  

Keep up the good work Casanovas of St. Louis!
