During Washington Montessori School&#8217;s career day a police officer decided it would be fun to arrest a six-year old because when he asked him his name he gave the officer a &#8220;fake name&#8221;. In a effort to make a point about lying to the police, the officer cuffed the child and put him in the back of his squad car. Guess what happened&#8230;no don&#8217;t bother, the kid cried. Probably because he was nervous, but maybe because he had weed in his pocket, but either way he cried, and now his mom is pissed!

> “This is not how you teach a 6-year-old to respect cops.  You just don’t,” Debbie Woodard, the boy’s mother, said.
> 
> Woodard tells News 4 she is not surprised how her son responded because he has always gone by his nickname ‘Jon Michael’ instead of his real name which is ‘Otis’.

It&#8217;s clear now that the officer should have arrested the mother for naming her kid &#8220;Otis&#8221; and for telling her child that &#8220;Jon Michael&#8221; is anything close to what a nickname should be. &#8220;Big O&#8221; maybe, or even &#8220;Skip&#8221;, but where is &#8220;Jon Michael&#8221; coming from? Is there an MTV <del>ripoff</del> service were you can text your name for $2.99 to find out your &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp7_u0kcQRo#t=9" target="_blank">Waltons Nickname</a>&#8221; or something?

As with any angry mom situation, both the police and the school are backing away slowly.

> “A young student was used in a demonstration with an officer on arrest procedure, and it upset the child and certainly I don’t think that was the police officer’s intent,” Patrick Wallace, the school district spokesman, said.
> 
> Police will only say they are conducting an internal investigation on the unidentified female officer, who works in the city’s traffic division.

Otis/Jon Michael/Little Liar&#8217;s mom is holding firm on her demand of an apology from the officer.

In a related story, why isn&#8217;t _Baywatch_ on TV anymore? It used to be all over the place on reruns, and now? Nothing. 200+ channels and none of them have _Baywatch_?! It&#8217;s stupid and we demand an apology for that&#8230;which is why it&#8217;s related. Also boobs, because the mom probably has some and that&#8217;s all _Baywatch_ was.

Damn we miss _Baywatch_.
