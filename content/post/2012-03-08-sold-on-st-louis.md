Sorry folks, but news is slow these days and we were super busy with other stuff so instead of just trying to <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2012/03/07/top-5-st-louis-falls-in-love-at-area-fast-food-resturants/" target="_blank">squeeze more juice out of the Craigslist orange</a>, we&#8217;re going to show you a short video. It&#8217;s like when your 4th grade teacher was really busy with her own stuff so didn&#8217;t have time to pretend to teach you facts you never need to know anyway. Quick name all the state capitols! &#8230;yeah, thought so. Just watch the movie and then put your head down on your desk for a little while until the bell rings.
