A sweet softball field and a parking lot.  That&#8217;s the awesome action going on next to Busch Stadium right now, and its here to stay for a little while.

Go St. Louis!

> Don&#8217;t expect to see the Ballpark Village site humming with construction next summer. The site, which is now home to a softball field and parking lot, will almost certainly look the same during the 2010 baseball season, said Bill DeWitt III, president of the St. Louis Cardinals.

> &#8220;We don&#8217;t have full confidence that this market is ready for it yet,&#8221; DeWitt said in an interview after he spoke Thursday about the economics of Major League Baseball at Webster University.
> 
> Asked if that might happen in 2010, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m done predicting.&#8221;

That&#8217;s cool.  We&#8217;re done looking for it.
