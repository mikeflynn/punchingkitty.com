It&#8217;s gross. Don&#8217;t care how late it is or hungry we are, we will never say yes to the fast food version of rib-jobbing a sweaty Mexican donkey ride guy.

> The victim told police that he and a 31-year-old white male were at the drive thru of Del Taco when they got into an argument. The victim said the suspect stabbed him with a knife.

The stabbing victim is in critical condition but stable. He&#8217;ll pull through.

The attacker, who actually ate some of the Del Taco he ordered is in far worse condition and may not make it through the night.

In fact, a recent study was completed that found the healthiest thing you can order at a Del Taco is a violent crime. Good thing they generally come free with your visit.
