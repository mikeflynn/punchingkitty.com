The crew was asked if they wanted to go out to St. Charles County to sample their best local flavors, but apparently Applebee&#8217;s hanging a Francis Howell jersey on the wall doesn&#8217;t mean you have any local claim to the Quesadilla Burger and it&#8217;s ability to &#8220;Take your taste buds for a Southwest joyride.&#8221;
