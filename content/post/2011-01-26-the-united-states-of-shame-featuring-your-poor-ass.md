<a href="http://pleated-jeans.com/2011/01/24/the-united-states-of-shame-chart/" target="_blank">Pleated Jeans.com</a> recently put together this map of our United States with each state decorated by one state that it is worst in the nation in. What better day to post this than on the day after our President&#8217;s State of the Union address?

Oh, I know what you&#8217;re thinking, guy with knife lodged in his belly, but Missouri isn&#8217;t the nation&#8217;s worst place for crime, that&#8217;s just St. Louis. The wise map picked bankruptcy as Missouri&#8217;s &#8220;best&#8221; worst ranking. So if you&#8217;re poor, this is all your fault. We were going to give you a dollar, but now, after this? &#8230;well we weren&#8217;t actually thinking of giving you a dollar, it would be too close to touching. We would have given you the &#8220;Sorry&#8221; look though, which we think is just as nice.

  Lots of other stuff on there that we figured Missouri had to be in the running for!
