Meanwhile, hate filled people somehow failed to noticed that the world did actually continue to spin and society as we know it, did go on.

In St. Clair:

> St. Clair County Clerk Bob Delaney reported that seven couples in the county had been united as of 9 AM and that he was expecting more to turn out.
> 
> “I expect them throughout the day,” Delaney said.

&#8230;and University City:

> Three same sex couples were lined up by 8 a.m. at City Hall to become the first government-sanctioned domestic partnership couples anywhere in St.Louis County.
> 
> Charles Redmond, who is retired from IBM, and Arthur Loporena, retired from sales at Macy&#8217;s, became the first on the registry. They have been partners for 42 years.
> 
> &#8220;We are overjoyed,&#8221; Redmond said.

It&#8217;s times like this when I feel like the camera of a news story about this should pan back to reveal a wall of screens showing similar stories and a shadowy figure in front pounding his fist on his chair. &#8220;How did we let this happen?! Why can&#8217;t we just convince gay people to keep playing along like they did in the past? It&#8217;s all that damn Matthew Broderick&#8217;s fault. Moron couldn&#8217;t even pick a beard right&#8230;Sarah Jessica Parker?! Come on! Everyone knows only gay guys and girls like her&#8230;she&#8217;s like a My Little Pony in expensive shoes.&#8221;
