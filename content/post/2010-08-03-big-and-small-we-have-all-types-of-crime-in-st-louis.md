One from a comedy and one basically from Heat but without Val Kilmer.

At 10a yesterday the Medicine Shoppe on Grand by City Diner had a man barge in with a gun demanding a bottle of oxycontin. Despite is weapon induced upper-hand, when chased by employees, the man ran down the street right past the police who turned around and caught the junkie.

On the other side of the scale, dudes with automatic weapons and cool black robbin&#8217; costumes jumped an armored car taking the cash and leaving the guards duct taped up in the back.

> They apparently waited on the lot until the first employee arrived at 5 a.m., police say. They followed him into the gray brick building and took his gun away. They forced him to punch in the security code of the vault, then waited for a second employee, who arrived at about 5:30 a.m. The business requires two employees to punch in codes before gaining access to the money, police said.

> One of the robbers was said to be armed with a small Uzi. Another had an AR15 rifle, and two carried .45-caliber semiautomatic handguns.

Damn dude. If movies have taught us anything though, the dumb muscle and the loud-mouth guy no one knows why they hire, but they do, will spend their chunk of the money quickly and draw attention to themselves causing the head bad-ass dude have to kill them, but by that time Officer Will Smith is on their trail and eventually they will end up in a crazy gun fight with a bunch of people followed by a short car chase where they finally get the bad guy&#8230;but watch out! He&#8217;s not dead and has a little gun! &#8230;oh good, you shot him just in time. Â Also Tea Leoni will stand around or lay on beds and look awesome (above).

As for that first crime, that dude&#8217;s just a dumbass.
