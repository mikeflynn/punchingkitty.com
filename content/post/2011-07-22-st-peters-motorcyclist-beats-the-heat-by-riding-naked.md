_**Update**: We had a super-quick Twitter interview with the man himself. Check it out below!_

St. Peters motorists yesterday evening were shocked after their eyes focused on the lilly white blur in the lane next to them. A naked dude on a motorcycle was seen heading east down Interstate 70, around the Cave Springs area, presumably heading MidRivers Mall or possibly Costco since jeans are really cheap there.

> “Nobody was upset with it. Actually, there were quite a few people who, let’s say, were quite excited by it,” Wilson observed.
> 
> No word on who the mystery man is or why he was riding in the nude. [It has been] speculated that it may have been related to the hot weather or part of a dare.

Of course it was a dare, the real question is why the hell would he choose to fullfil said dare on 70 during rush hour as Mr. Naked Daredevil, like everyone else, got caught in a traffic jam. Even then, no one really seemed to mind since even being stuck next to this is better than rolling up next to the crazy-haired old fat lady shoveling down McDonalds in one hand and talking on the phone in the other.

One day later and his identity is still a mystery. He has no identifying marks and none of the photos show any plate numbers on the bike. All we have to go on are a helmet, some shoes and the bike itself. If anyone knows who this is, send him our way! <del>We&#8217;ve love to ask him a few questions (anonymously of course).</del> We got our chance! Here&#8217;s our quick Twitter interview with St. Peters&#8217; naked biker:

Now it&#8217;s left to St. Charles&#8217; no-fun patrol to go around and find this mystery man. St. Peters police are already sweeping the area, finding blue motorcycles and hesitantly sniffing the seats for that sour, incriminating man-ass sweat smell&#8230;which is now yet another reason to sell that bike or at least throw that seat away as soon as possible.
