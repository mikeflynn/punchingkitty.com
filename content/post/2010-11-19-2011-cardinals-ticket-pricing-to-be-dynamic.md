The St. Louis Cardinals have announce that starting with next season their tickets will all be &#8220;dynamically priced&#8221; based on a variety of options:

> Utilizing advanced computer programming linked to its new ticketing system, the Cardinals will have the ability to adjust ticket prices upward or downward on a daily basis based on changing factors such as team performance, pitching matchups, and the weather.

Unmentioned in the press release was the fact that the &#8220;advanced computer programming&#8221; is actually _a giant knob_ in Bill Dewitt&#8217;s office marked &#8220;Ticket Prices&#8221;. The knob was installed earlier this week and was mounted directly to the right of the &#8220;release the hounds&#8221; button that successfully got Jason Marquis out of town.

We at Punching Kitty, because we are amazing journalists, have the exclusive photo of that knob:
