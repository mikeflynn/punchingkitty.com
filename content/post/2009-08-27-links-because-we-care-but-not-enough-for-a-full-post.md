The RiverFrontTimes&#8217; DailyRFT has [Jeff Smith&#8217;s resignation letter][1], plus about 300 other posts about Jeff Smith.

JoeSportsFan.com has video of my personal favorite [Busch Stadium beer vendor][2] showing how the pros announce what they are selling!

Who loves the bad economy?  [Libraries of course][3]!

Speaking of libraries, [apparently you can masturbate in them][4]!  Who knew?  Not me!  I mean there are some computers that I think are pretty covered so I mean its wouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal, but&#8230;look, I mean who&#8217;s to say what constitutes masturbating anyway?

The [PlayBack STL Music Festival line up][5] was just announced. (via @[philberger][6])
