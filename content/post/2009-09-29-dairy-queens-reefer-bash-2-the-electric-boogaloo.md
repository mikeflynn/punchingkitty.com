Sometimes things are so awesome, you have no choice but to squeeze a sequel out.  Take Legally Blonde, wait no&#8230;Teen Wolf!&#8230;err&#8230;um&#8230;Speed!!  Nevermind.  Movies are a bad example, but [Dairy Queen&#8217;s &#8220;Titz n&#8217; Reefer Bash&#8221; from a few days back][1] is!

Oh thats right!  Our eagled-eye&#8217;d (or horny, pot smoking) reader has spotted a change to the sign!  Note the now added &#8220;2&#8221; on the left but still the same awesome-adding &#8220;69&#8221; on the right.

I like to think they these parties are run by a group of rough-around-the-edges but lovable kids that have had a rough go of it and just desperately need the money a party like this brings in to keep their community center safe from an evil old white-guy developer that wants to turn it in to a movie theatre or strip mall.  The problem is that these kids can&#8217;t dance, so there goes a money-making dance show, and they can&#8217;t sing&#8230;but they can get their hands on large amounts of pot and know a bunch of sluts!  Bingo.
