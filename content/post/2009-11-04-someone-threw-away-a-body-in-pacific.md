> The Major Case Squad is investigating a body found in an apartment complex trash bin.
> 
> The body was found Tuesday afternoon at the Monroe Woods Apartments in Pacific.

You want details?  Well guess what crimestoppers!

> Investigators have not said if the body is that of a man or a woman, nor have they commented on how it appears the person died.
> 
> The apartment complex is located off Monroe Street, just a few hundred yards from Interstate 44.

Nothing.  Well, at least KSDK managed to kind of look up the address.  There&#8217;s some sleuthing for ya!

Here is where the silly blogger is should be putting lots of jokes about a &#8220;throw away society&#8221; or how we are all very wasteful, throwing away good human&#8217;s like that, but we aren&#8217;t going to do that.  Those kind of jokes are horrible!  This man or woman (KSDK is fairly certain its a human) had a family dammit!  This person had a mom, and probably siblings and maybe even a boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife!  Low brow humor like that makes us sick.

Of course out there, their mom, sibling and significant other were probably all the same person&#8230;and they were probably the ones that killed them and tossed their body in the trash in the first place&#8230;so it might not be that sad&#8230;still a little sad&#8230;unless they were trying to make some artistic point about &#8220;white trash,&#8221; which in that case it&#8217;s innovating!
