St. Louis is #3 on the most dangerous American cities list&#8230;again. Old news. We are always on there. We&#8217;re like that kid that wears the leather jacket no matter how hot it gets and uses a switch blade comb. We&#8217;re bad ass. We know it.

Well, I guess not everyone knows it. (Watch out people at work, this dude is loud!)

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/BPGB4pxcVVw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

At the end of his little tirade, he shows the whole list. Note that if you think you are just having a stroke because you can&#8217;t seem to lock in and read the list very well, don&#8217;t worry. Its just because this genius though the best way to display the list is with black text on a bright red background&#8230;that blinks.

If you can keep it together to watch most of the list without stroking out, you&#8217;ll see that our retarded cross-state brother city we only visit once a year or because we find out he can count cards Kansas City came in at #6. Nice try KC. Still not impressed.
