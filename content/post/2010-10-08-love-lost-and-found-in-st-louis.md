  From time to time we like to dip in to the ole Missed Connections section in St. Louis&#8217; own Craigslist. Why? Because these things are crazy stupid. Like KSDK <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GailPennington/status/26671987647" target="_blank">airing a show about Cardinals highlights Thursday night during prime-time</a> stupid.

Nothing like spending your dinner trying to avoid eye-contact from the creepy guy a few tables away that clearly never did get the hint to make Denny&#8217;s somehow suck even more.

Wow. Gross. Anyone have any freaking idea what &#8220;ruff def the trigger tonite.&#8221; is supposed to mean? Anyone want to draw us a picture? Also, if you were wondering, the town of &#8220;always wet&#8221; isn&#8217;t Chesterfield, its a reference to her vagina&#8230;or rather that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarlacc" target="_blank">sarlacc pit</a> she pretends still resembles a human vagina.
