For those with lives that missed VH1&#8217;s _Rock of Love Bus_ this week, the skank mobile parked in St. Louis where Brett took the girls to the Hustler Club (shocking right?) and Uncle Joe&#8217;s Flamingo Bowl on Washington.  Great for Joe!  Bad for everyone that watched it, especially for those that live in Missouri because we got to watch the dumbest skanks VH1 could find have an exchange about where exactly St. Louis is:



I get itchy and my dick burns after just watching those broads. Double-bag it Brett!
