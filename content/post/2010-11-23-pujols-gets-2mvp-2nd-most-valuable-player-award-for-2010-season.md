[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6152" title="albert pujols" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/08/albert-pujols.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="217" />][1]The Cardinals&#8217; Albert Pujols lost the vote for the 2010 National League MVP, coming in second to the Reds&#8217; Joey Votto, but did get his 8th consecutive top 10 finish, putting him only behind Barry &#8220;Yeah, right there. Shove it in my ass!&#8221; Bonds who had 9.

Though Pujols was next in line, the vote was hardly close with Pujols only getting one 1st place vote. A vote that ESPN.com made sure to call out the scribe that cast it:

> Pujols, the St. Louis Cardinals&#8217; first baseman, was second with the remaining first-place vote, from Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and 279 points (Votto had 443 points) after winning the award in 2005, 2008 and 2009.

Way to be Strauss, sticking with the 314 and assure yourself that exclusive Pujols interview this off-season! More shocking is that Pujols himself may have hurt his chances this year by talking up a young player a few years ago giving him the confidence to be the best&#8230;[fade to flashback]

> Joey Votto and Albert Pujols had a long conversation behind the batting cage before a game a few years ago.
> 
> &#8220;There&#8217;s something about a star player of that magnitude kind of pulling you in and saying, it&#8217;s OK, we can talk, don&#8217;t be a rookie right now, we&#8217;re going to talk like men,&#8221; Votto said. &#8220;I think he made me feel comfortable and a little more confident.&#8221;

Well that was dumb. Next time, if you think the kid has talent, tell him that the NFL is the place to be and get him out of the way. Feel free to talk up all the Pedro Felizes, Cubs players, or Aaron Mileses of the world though. They can have confidence scooped up and pour directly in to every orifice and still look like their going to the plate with a pool noodle instead of a bat.
