He parked in a lot to run inside and&#8230;well&#8230;it turned out to be a valet lot, so that made the little valet guy angry. <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/02/tmz-on-tv-piece-clip-nfl-superbowl-champ-dmarco-farr-valet-video/" target="_blank">Cue TMZ&#8217;s cameras!</a>

This morning we heard that **Bob Stelton** stood up for Farr saying that he offered to pay, which honestly seems fair, but after watching the tape, maybe he could have offered to pay a little more nicely. After &#8220;Jesus F\*cking Christ!&#8221; and &#8220;Do you need a tip?! I&#8217;ll give you a f\*cking tip!&#8221; it may have turned in to a spite situation.

101ESPN says that D&#8217;Marco will address the situation on his Fast Lane show later today, but what&#8217;s to address? The tape is the tape and maybe the St. Louis sports radio public will forgive and forget. We do have a pretty good understand to how &#8220;f*cking cold outside&#8221; it really is.
