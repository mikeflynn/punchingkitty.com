> I need you now, come to my office&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I&#8217;m alone

Hell yeah! Awwwww&#8230;.just girls. Figures! Did we uncover some secret message passing system from adulterers? Also why did he have to explicitly say he was alone? That&#8217;s not implied? Is &#8220;I need you now, come to my office&#8230;&#8230;_My mom is here_.&#8221; something that could reasonably happen in this relationship?
