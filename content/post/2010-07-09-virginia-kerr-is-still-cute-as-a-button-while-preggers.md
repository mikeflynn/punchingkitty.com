> Two more weeks until the third trimester! I’m so excited, I think I may have to celebrate that day with ice cream!
> 
> BUT it also makes me worry stretch marks are right around the corner. So far, so good but I’ve been reading women get them as late as three days before they give birth.
> 
> I’ve been dedicated to putting lotion on my belly, hips and chest every day. I started with that Tummy Butter but it’s too greasy so I just use my Bath and Body Works lotion. Then, I read this week that you can’t do ANYTHING  to prevent because it’s all genetics.

Um gross.

It&#8217;s ok though because Virginia is still cute, despite her passenger and possible future genetic stretchmarks (right).

The important thing is she isn&#8217;t making a big deal about our whole babby daddy drama and trying to at get my money yo. Usually bitches be trippin&#8217;.
