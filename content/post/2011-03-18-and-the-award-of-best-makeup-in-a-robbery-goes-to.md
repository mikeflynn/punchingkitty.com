This dude, who robbed a St. Charles gas station after going through all the trouble to make himself look like a mexican with a goatee despite the fact that we can see his white guy neck. The goatee looks really nice though&#8230;didn&#8217;t really color outside the lines at all! Maybe next time, think about going with the sombrero&#8230;really drive it home!
