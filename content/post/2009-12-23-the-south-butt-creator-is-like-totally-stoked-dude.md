&#8220;When they tried to take me to court, it was like the best Christmas present ever.&#8221;

oh and&#8230;

&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know [why the North Face is trying to sue me].  I don&#8217;t see any similarities between the two companies.&#8221;

Those are the words from Mizzou student and owner of the now famous parody brand &#8220;The South Butt&#8221;.

Jimmy Winkelmann _[Editor&#8217;s Note: Great freaking name! Seriously.]_ was recently interviewed by KSDK and came off calm, cool (totally rad?), and more than a little innocent as to trademark law.  (View the interview after the jump)

Will Jimmy lose this case?

From our research&#8230;probably.  Here&#8217;s what we found pertaining to copyright law and parody logos (<a href="http://www.publaw.com/parody.html" target="_blank">Publaw.com</a>):

> Since copyright law prohibits the substantial use of a copyrighted work without permission of the copyright owner, and because such permission is highly unlikely when the use is to create a parody, it may be necessary for the parodist to rely on the fair-use defense to forestall any liability for copyright infringement. However, the fair-use defense if successful will only be successful when the newly created work that purports itself to be parody is a valid parody.
> 
> Although not every commercial use is presumptively an unfair use, and therefore conclusively determinative against fair use, this criterion emphasizes a preference that fair use will be granted to those works that are created for noncommercial or educational purposes rather than for commercial purposes.
> 
> The burden of proving fair use is usually much easier to demonstrate if the new work is for one of the &#8220;favored&#8221; purposes: criticism, comment, scholarship, research, news reporting or teaching

Winkelmann&#8217;s only hope is 2 Live Crew.  Yes 2 Live Crew&#8217;s case with Roy Orbison about the &#8220;parody&#8221; song &#8220;Pretty Woman&#8221;.  After going to the Supreme Court, 2 Live Crew&#8217;s version that they release and sold, was found to be a parody and thus protected, because they were found to be making a criticism of the original song.

There Jimmy Winkelmann, is your legal safe house.  Go there now.

Oh and for the record, we think all of this is freaking hilarious.
