> He made the official announcement that his band, named the “Lt. Dan Band” after his character in that 1994 film, will play a Memorial Day weekend concert on May 27th at the St. Charles Family Arena.
> 
> Sinise announced that proceeds from every ticket sold for the May 27th concert will go towards construction of a Smart Home for Corporal Nicely, part of a project sponsored by the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation.

Woah wait a minute. For one, Gary Sinise is in a band? &#8230;and two, he named it the &#8220;Lt. Dan Band&#8221;?! &#8230;and three, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp38ezo4j50" target="_blank">this video</a> shows all members of the band are not only fully able, but doing things like dancing, finger picking a bass guitar and putting their arms around each other? False advertising to say the least, but just plain flaunting your non-hook-based limbs is more like it. Still give all ticket sales to disabled vets, but change the name of the band to the more apt &#8220;That one guy from the movies&#8230;you know who I&#8217;m talking about&#8230;the guy! &#8230;he&#8217;s on CSI now&#8230;no, the other one&#8230;the non-black or ginger one Band&#8221;

Oh and maybe get Tom Hanks to make a band and open for him.
