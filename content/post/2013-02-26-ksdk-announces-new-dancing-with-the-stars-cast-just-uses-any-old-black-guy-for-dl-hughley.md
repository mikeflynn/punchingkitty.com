**Update:** The slideshow has since been fixed by KSDK, and you&#8217;re welcome DL Hughley!

Original post follow&#8230;

_Is this DL Hughley? Anyone? Eh, close enough. I remembered he was black&#8230;and a comedian&#8230;how many of them can there be?_

Good try KSDK, but a whiff for sure. One might ask: &#8220;Why the hell is local news channel KSDK making incorrect slide shows concerning the cast of a long-running national reality show that airs on a different local affiliate?&#8221; &#8230;and that would be a good question! Someone should definitely ask that.
