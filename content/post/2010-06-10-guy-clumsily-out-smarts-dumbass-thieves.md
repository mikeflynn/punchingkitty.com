KSDK is reporting both on their site and on the air that a Jefferson County man outsmarted his home intruder. The guy got away, so I guess this is kinda true&#8230;but, we think the word &#8220;outsmarted&#8221; might be overstating things a little.  Judge for yourself.

> One of [the] victims they say thought fast to protect his home and future wife.
> 
> When 26 year old Nick Barr got up for a drink of water just before 1 a.m. Tuesday, he flipped on the light and saw a stranger in his home holding a rifle.
> 
> &#8220;He just said, &#8216;don&#8217;t move,&#8217; were the only words he said,&#8221; says Barr. &#8220;Soon as he said that it was like telling me to run. I just bolted immediately.&#8221;
> 
> And he was thinking fast, too. Barr says he switched off the lights, shut the bedroom door behind him and yelled the first thing that came to mind.
> 
> &#8220;I was yelling at him and told him I had a gun and a phone,&#8221; said Barr who was trying to protect himself and his fiancé.
> 
> &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just stay still and do what he said you know, because that would leave her defenseless so I had to do something,&#8221; said Barr who when asked if he did in fact have a gun said, &#8220;Not that I could reach. But you got to do something so that&#8217;s what I told him.&#8221;

When we think of someone that &#8220;outsmarted&#8221; a burglar, we think along the lines of diving behind the couch, assembling a gun with his slipper, a pencil and a rubber band&#8230;maybe even just doing the old bugs bunny trick of saying &#8220;You want my money.&#8221; over and over again until switching to &#8220;You don&#8217;t want my money.&#8221; at the last second. He&#8217;d be all like &#8220;Crap. Got me!&#8221; and then just leave and go get a smoothie or something. Maybe an anvil would fall on his head, not sure how that one ends exactly.  Either way, locking yourself in a closet and saying &#8220;I have a gun!&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exactly register with us on our &#8220;outsmarted&#8221; scale. Isn&#8217;t the move to just shoot the door if you are the bad guy?  That&#8217;s the answer. We would have also accepted &#8220;Take a bunch shit since the guy did you the favor of locking himself in a room.&#8221;

You know what the _real_ story is here? This guy looks just like Ryan Dunn from MTV&#8217;s old Jackass show:
