If you live in reach of Laclede Gas and you pay their rates you&#8217;re going to love this.  I mean you&#8217;re _really_ going to love this! 

From [BizJournals.com][1] article &#8220;Laclede Q1 profit up 50%&#8221; [emphasis mine]:

> Laclede Gas, the company’s core unit, saw its earnings rise 2.5 percent to $16.2 million in the recent quarter. **The company attributed the increase to higher income from natural gas sales due to colder weather <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and higher surcharge revenue</span>**, offset by higher operating expenses and investment losses.

So&#8230;

**Interview Guy:** &#8220;Wow, you guys did pretty well in the first quarter, why do you think that is?&#8221;

**Laclede PR:** &#8220;We&#8217;ve been charging a lot more for gas.&#8221;

**Interview Guy:** &#8220;Huh.  I guess that would do it.&#8221;

Look at the stones on you Laclede.  Seriously, thats basically exactly how it went down!  Are you freaking kidding me?  Wow.

Ok, I think I have a few pitchforks&#8230;anyone want to supply the torches and meet by the old mill around 9p tomorrow?
