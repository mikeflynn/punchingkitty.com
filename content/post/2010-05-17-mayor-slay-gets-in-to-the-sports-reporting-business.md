Last Wednesday our honorable Mayor Francis Slay, <a href="http://www.mayorslay.com/blog/post.php?postID=17230" target="_blank">took to his blog</a> and proceeded to, out of nowhere, dick-punch former Rams owner-in-waiting Shahid Khan by backing the &#8220;familiar face&#8221; of Stan Kroenke.

> Two potential new majority owners have emerged. One is a familiar billionaire face [Stan Kroenke] with generally unknown, but demonstrably successful, views. The other [Shahid Khan] is an unfamiliar very, very rich face with widely known, but generally untested, views. I&#8217;d pick the tested billionaire owner.

Not sure this does any good what so ever there your Mayor-ness. What is the point of this? You trying to back the probable winner to make sure you get some games in the owners box?

Post Dispatch sports scribe Bernie Miklasz also seemed a little weirded out by the Mayor sudden take on local sports as he quipped in his Saturday &#8220;<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/columnists.nsf/berniemiklasz/story/69EE17BFC4578DFA8625772400104BAA?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Bernie&#8217;s Bits&#8221; column</a>:

> Perhaps the mayor can give us his views on the pitcher batting eighth in his next blog.

&#8230;which apparently the Mayor reads, as later on Saturday, Mayor Slay <a href="http://www.mayorslay.com/blog/post.php?postID=17231" target="_blank">posted</a>:

> **Position Players Hitting 9th**
> 
> Tony La Russa is the only manager in the National League to bat a position player ninth regularly. Other managers, Ned Yost and John Russell come to mind, have done so occasionally.
> 
> La Russaâ€™s unorthodox practice drives some sportswriters crazy, but it makes sense to me. With Big Bats hitting third in the lineup (McGwire in 1998, Pujols in 2008, 2009), putting an additional player more likely than a light-hitting pitcher to get on base ahead of the Big Bats seems like a prudent idea. La Russa, who keeps charts about just about everything, is certain of it.

Well played Mr. Mayor&#8230;still have no idea why you would think it was a good idea to back a potential owner and throw more drama in an already crazy situation though.

Oh that&#8217;s right, you&#8217;re the mayor of St. Louis. You like the crazy.
