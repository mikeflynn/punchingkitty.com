According to both the <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/05/post-dispatch_changes_coverage_at_city_hall_jake_wagman_david_hunn.php#more" target="_blank">Riverfront Times</a> and the <a href="http://interact.stltoday.com/blogzone/political-fix/political-fix/2010/05/changes-to-the-p-d-politics-team/" target="_blank">Post-Dispatch</a>, our local dead-tree news source is moving some people around slightly in their jobs. Initial speculation is that the Post Dispatch celebrated the internal holiday of &#8220;Pretend Any of This Matters&#8221; Day&#8230;or just needed to fill a little space on page 14 between the first ad and the other four.

> Most noticeable among those is the switch at City Hall where education reporter **David Hunn** will step in for**Jake Wagman** who&#8217;s covered St. Louis politics for much of the past decade.

> In other P-D news&#8230;

> Former transportation reporter **Elisa Crouch** &#8212; who&#8217;s been away on maternity leave &#8212; will step in to cover city schools and other education issues for the paper. **Ken Leiser**, who covered transporation along with Crouch, will continue to report on the subject solo.

Well that&#8217;s what you get for taking maternity leave Elisa Crouch! &#8230;no one&#8217;s saying you shouldn&#8217;t have a baby, but if you don&#8217;t squeeze that kid out and then come back to work we&#8217;ll just pretend your job is safe until you come back and some new hot girl is at your desk and we say &#8220;Oh&#8230;hey. Ummmm&#8230;its Reassignment Day! Please move your stuff to any one of the empty desks I can&#8217;t see from my office.&#8221;

Don&#8217;t believe us? Look at Madonna&#8217;s Skeleton. She never takes maternity leave, she just steals kids from other countries because she knows if her old Skeletor-looking ass would get fired from that &#8220;Queen of Pop&#8221; title the minute we get the chance but she just never leaves her desk. Hell she didn&#8217;t even take time off when the rest of her died in 2002, her skeleton just kept showing up.

We banged your mom. That&#8217;s how. Don&#8217;t question us.
