It all started with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/D_Alexander84/status/28883941544" target="_blank">an early morning tweet</a> by Alexander saying simply &#8220;Good morning people!! I have a surprise for you today.&#8221;

A few hours later two more tweets followed with attached photos of Bradford rocking his personalized Mizzou jersey with his old college days number 14 on the front:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7563" title="bradford_in_mizzou_jersey_for_reals" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/10/bradford_in_mizzou_jersey_for_reals.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="247" />][2]When reporters asked if Bradford ever thought about going to Mizzou out of high school, the media-savvy rookie quarterback replied:

> Absolutely not, I wanted to win Big 12 championships.

&#8230;and what will he do with his personalized Mizzou jersey?

> It&#8217;s going right back to Mr. Alexander. He can take it wherever he got it.

Full photos after the jump!
