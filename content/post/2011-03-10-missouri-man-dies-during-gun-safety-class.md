Apparently it&#8217;s the second half of the Mountain Grove, Missouri (it&#8217;s by Springfield) gun safety class that makes the real impact.

> Authorities say 63-year-old Glenn Seymour of Mountain Grove died after shooting himself in the chest Saturday at a class in rural Douglas County
> 
> Sheriff Chris Degase says witnesses reported that Seymour was injured while trying to take the safety off a Browning semi-automatic 9 mm weapon.

Right after the break they were going to go over the part where you learn to not point the gun at your chest&#8230;ever. If only Jerry wouldn&#8217;t have brought in so much orange juice we wouldn&#8217;t have had to break for the bathroom&#8230;no&#8230;it&#8217;s best not to think about &#8220;what if&#8217;s&#8221;.

What do you do if you&#8217;re in the class when something like this happens? Is the whole class&#8217; safety certificates invalidated or does just the one guy that shot himself fail? Seems harsh, but he did shoot himself in the middle of a safety course&#8230;gotta think something like that would have ended up on the final exam.
