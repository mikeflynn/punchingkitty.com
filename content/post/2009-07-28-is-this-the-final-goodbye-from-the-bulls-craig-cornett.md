Our sources say he posted this on [his Facebook profile][2] last night:

> Hey everyone&#8230; I wish I could explain everything, but just hang in there and someday soon&#8230; uh, um, ahh&#8230; I think I&#8217;ve said too much. As MacArthur said &#8220;I shall return!&#8221; Wait&#8230; the Filipino people waited over 2 years. I would never do that to you. Think of me more like Tupac. A hail of bullets and even death will not be enough to shut me up! I will be posting as often as possible. God Bless You All

That sure doesn&#8217;t sound like &#8220;Man I love my job and I will totally have it still a week from now&#8221; to us.

As many of  you know, Cornett, the morning show host on local Country music radio station, 93.7 the Bull, was on a prolonged, and mysterious absence and then returned fairly recently.  Because of that, this news might not be much of a shock since prolonged and mysterious absences are rarely good for one&#8217;s career.

As always we&#8217;ll keep you all updated if we hear anything else.

I bet he&#8217;s wishing he would have wasted his custom Facebook profile name with &#8220;craigcornettmornings&#8221; now.
