Besides the fact that the poor emo kids that are too pussy to buy real weed are now really sad and won&#8217;t stop watching their Twilight DVD, something else amazing happened! Channel 4, KMOV, learned a little bit about how America works.  Good for them.

> Tabbat&#8217;s store [the South 94 Bait and Tackle Trading shop] sells fishing tackle and smoking supplies, but business was slow until K2 came along. The owner admits there were days when her sales reached $7,000.

> Now Tabbat&#8217;s customers are going to St. Louis County to buy K2, which means she will have to make job cuts. &#8220;The sad thing is I had hired three people, said Tabbat. &#8220;Now, I am going to have to lay them off.&#8221;

Oh. So making something illegal makes things tough on people trying to sell it legally huh?  I had no idea. That is so strange. How did all those bars make do during the prohibition?

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, not well.
