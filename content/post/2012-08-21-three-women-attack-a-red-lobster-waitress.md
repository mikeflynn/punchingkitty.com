For the second time in 9 months a Red Lobster employee has been attacked at the Fairview Heights Red Lobster. Apparently the cheddar biscuits are horrible there.

> At about 2:15 p.m. Friday, a restaurant worker had water thrown on her and was struck repeatedly by either open hands or Red Lobster menus, police said. Three suspects were taken into custody. Police said they do not yet know what led to the alleged assault.

Horrible base pay, little to no tips from the ghetto patrons, getting to come home smelling like horrible warmed-over frozen fish, and the constant threat of beatings? All this can be yours if you apply at the Fairview Heights Red Lobster, which happens to have an opening!

> Sharrell A. Evans, 21, of the 5800 block of Bret Michael Drive in Belleville, and Britley L. Green, 22, and Geneen L. Green, 44, of the 7000 block of Gary Drive in St. Clair County were being held in lieu of $50,000 bail at the Fairview Heights Police Department. They were charged with the felonies of mob action and aggravated battery in a public place.

  Was the waitress slow in bringing back the next round of &#8220;endless shrimp&#8221;? Were the biscuits cold? Did the waitress look like the ho that used to be all up on their cousin Ray-Ray back in the day? Did she fail to mention how great you looked in your &#8220;Bahama Mama&#8221; t-shirt featuring a sunbathing cat wearing sunglasses?

Any of these would be great reasons to flip out on a waitress in a restaurant by throwing water and beating her with the menus, but not complementing you on your shirt that is not only fashion forward, but is also just thin enough were it looks like we can see your bra through it? Bitch got off easy.
