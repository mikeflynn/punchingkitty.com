  Today&#8217;s top goings on&#8230;
</div>

  1. <a href="http://foursquare.tumblr.com/post/213931642/foursquare-taking-north-america-by-storm" target="_blank">FourSquare officially launched in St. Louis</a>! ([We told you][1]&#8230;just sayin.)
  2. Pujols f<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/E893D8464F515EAB86257651000F68EE?OpenDocument" target="_blank">reaked out the Cardinals</a> with his comments on some crazy Dominican radio station.
  3. The RFT took an idea off the table for us <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2009/10/st_louis_website_retailer_growing_leaps_and_bounds_woot_dot_com.php" target="_blank">by exploring the W00t! offices</a>.
  4. [Metro Link gives up][2] and ask the rest of us for ideas.  Can&#8217;t get any worse I guess.
  5. <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/718F0A79A6544AE28625765000101C4F?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Bowling allies are freaking out about the smoking bans</a>.  They think if we take away the smoke smell, the BO smell will get lonely.
