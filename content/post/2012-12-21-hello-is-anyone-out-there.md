Guys? Hello?! Did the apocalypse happen?

Honestly, we don&#8217;t know because there&#8217;s been a row of broken busted-ass buildings outside our bedroom window for a long time now, and so it&#8217;s pretty hard to tell if the world ended, or we&#8217;re just still looking at the same &#8220;historical landmarks&#8221; we always see. Someone call San Francisco and ask if things look different over there because we just aren&#8217;t sure in St. Louis. Yeah, we could check the _other_ upstairs window, but we&#8217;re still pretty snugly and there&#8217;s no point in getting out of bed if the world ended.

Kinda felt like having internet access was a good sign, and &#8220;Maury&#8221; is on, but we&#8217;re pretty sure we&#8217;ve seen this paternity test already so it&#8217;s a tough call&#8230;anyone alive out there?!

Thanks.
