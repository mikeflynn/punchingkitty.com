We haven&#8217;t mentioned it much on the site yet (other than our header ad you might have seen) but we&#8217;ve hooked up with KTRS&#8217; The John Carney Show to do a weekly on air segment. We discuss what was on the site over the last week, or other random shiz with Carney and then we&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s simple, fun, and since it&#8217;s radio, we don&#8217;t have to wear pants.

The show airs weeknights at 9p &#8211; 12am and we usually go on around the 9:45p on Thursdays.

Here&#8217;s last Thursday&#8217;s audio:
