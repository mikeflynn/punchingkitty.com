Two Poplar Bluff brothers went in to cardiac arrest at virtually the exact same time right next to one another.

> When Crocket Lacy went into cardiac arrest, he was lucky his brother, Ronnie, was there.
> 
> Then Ronnie had his own heart attack. Both men were taken to a Poplar Bluff hospital emergency room, where both of their hearts stopped virtually simultaneously.
> 
> Both were saved, but doctors are still amazed at the coincidence of two brothers going &#8220;code blue&#8221; at the same time.

One called the other because he didn&#8217;t feel well, and when brother #2 got to brother #1&#8217;s house brother #1 went in to cardiac arrest.  By the time the family got to the hospital, brother #2 arrested&#8230;all while a third brother stood there watching it all waiting for the lightning bolt to take him out.

Oh and if you were wondering if the the weak-hearted brothers were thinking about pressing charges on statistically odd occurances, don&#8217;t because the Post Dispatch is there to ask the questions no one wants answered already!

> The near-simultaneous heart attacks appeared to be an unlucky coincidence, and police said they weren&#8217;t investigating.

&#8230;all while their two wives sat in the corner with their matching top hats and twirling their matching mustaches.

Both brothers are recovering by the way.

> [Brother #1] had triple-bypass surgery and was well enough to celebrate his 48th birthday on March 5.
> 
> [Brother #2] condition was more serious but he is improving. Eric said [Brother #2] was on life-support for a while. His kidneys still aren&#8217;t functioning properly.
