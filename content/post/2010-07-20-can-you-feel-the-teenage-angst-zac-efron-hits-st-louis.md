Zac Efron, the star of the famous High School Singy Song Show With Chicks That Are Way to Hot to be In Disney Movies Music (or whatever) movie series, is coming to St. Louis tomorrow to show his new, non-signing movie _Charlie St. Cloud_.

You might be asking yourself &#8220;Why would he do that?&#8221;

We don&#8217;t know.

Oh wait yes we do. Someone won a contest or something.

> The 22-year-old _Charlie St. Cloud_actor will be heading to St. Louis, Missouri NEXT Wednesday, July 21 to premiere his flick with the winner of the nationwide hometown screening contest — **Jerry Sanoval, 43**.

Ha. No, we&#8217;re kidding. The winner&#8217;s name is **Emily Johnson**. Having a pervy 43 year old dude win would be far more funny though.

Other situations that would make this more funny include: Some sort of cream pie gag, several rubber chickens attending the show somehow and Zac bringing girlfriend and co-star Vanessa Hudgens over to our place to keep her company while he&#8217;s at the premiere.

The last one is funny because we would be like &#8220;Whoa that actually happened. That&#8217;s funny.&#8221; The rest of it wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;funny&#8221; pre se.
