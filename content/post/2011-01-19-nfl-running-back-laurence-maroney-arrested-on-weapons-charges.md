St. Louis native and current Denver Broncos running back **Laurence Maroney** was arrested Sunday night for unlawful weapons and drug charges. Let us guess: All that stuff belonged to your buddies and you didn&#8217;t know they had it?

> &#8220;Mr. Maroney was unlawfully arrested for possession of weapons. He holds a permit to carry a concealed weapon and he had his permit on his person when he was arrested. He was not arrested for any drugs nor was he involved in a high speed chase. He was released without being charged with any offense and we do not anticipate he will be charged with any criminal offense,&#8221; according to the statement given to KMOV.com.

<a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/01/Laurence-Maroney-mugshot-1.jpeg" target="_blank">Mugshot</a>! (We&#8217;d so do that with our hair if we could. That or the Kid n&#8217; Play &#8220;House Party&#8221; look. Spazy and un-combed straight hair is pretty close though. Word.)

Police reports contend that a 25-year old (Maroney&#8217;s age) was indicated that he had a valid conceal and carry permit, didn&#8217;t have it on him, and was arrested for possessing a firearm while under the influence of drugs. That report conflicts, to some degree, with the statement above.

Lets say he does have that gun legally, and maybe he wasn&#8217;t smoking any of the drugs, and maybe he was just high-speed chase adjacent&#8230;but that seems like an awful lot of crimes to be around without being involved in any of them doesn&#8217;t it? At best, Maroney, the former New England Patriot, needs some new St. Louis friends, but at worst he could be looking at a stiff punishment for any of those crimes he &#8220;witnessed&#8221;.

Playing for the Denver Broncos last year might count as &#8220;time served&#8221; though, so he might be ok after all.
