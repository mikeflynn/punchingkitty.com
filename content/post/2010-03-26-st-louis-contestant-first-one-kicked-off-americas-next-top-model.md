I know!! We&#8217;re shocked too! We had no idea this show was still on! Much like Tyra Banks&#8217; dress sized the seasons keep get on bigger and bigger&#8230;this season that just began is 14.  Jesus. 14! For a reality show at that.

Well 14 is apparently the season that someone from St. Louis finally made the cut. Yea!

&#8230;but she was the first one kicked off.

Boo.

Why Tyra?! Why would you kick off the St. Louis girl&#8230;and first! Oh. Because she was a scary looking:
