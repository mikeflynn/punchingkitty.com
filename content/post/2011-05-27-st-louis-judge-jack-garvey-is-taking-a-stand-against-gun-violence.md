City Judge Jack Garvey (not pictured) has decided that enough is enough with the gun-related violence in the city and is doing what he can to stop it. Specficially, he&#8217;s taking every gun-related case that comes through his courtroom and multiplying the standard bond by 10.

> Judge Jack Garvey is now requiring suspects to post from $30,000 to $50,000 cash bond to be released until their case is heard.
> 
> Garvey was asked what kind of impact he hopes that will make.
> 
> “I don’t know,” Garvey admitted.  “I don’t know, but what we do know is that if there is one less person who’s off the street without a gun, there’s a better chance that people will be safer in the city.”

Way to go Judge Garvey! &#8230;what&#8217;s this?! Oh yeah, it&#8217;s happening&#8230;slow clap!

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/whytAReStUQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

Ok, so the _Cool Runnings_ slow clap is all I could find, but I think it gets the job done. If you could just mentally replace Doug E. Doug (Pictured&#8230;yeah, now you get it!) with Judge Garvey and then forget for a second your questions about why he&#8217;s carrying a bobsled, we think it might help.

Any chance Judge Garvey might feel like running for mayor?
