From the moment we posted about Dan McLaughlin this morning, we&#8217;ve been hearing report after report from all over about how lots and lots of people don&#8217;t like old &#8220;Danny Mac&#8221;. Lots of people are, dare we say, happy about this little traffic stop and following mug shot.

&#8230;and then we got this thrown our way:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6377" title="people_hate_dan_mclaughlin" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/08/people_hate_dan_mclaughlin.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="500" />][1]

The fact that someone took the time to make and circulate this says a lot. Also of note is that we still can&#8217;t look at that mugshot without giggling.

We&#8217;ve never talked with him, and have no official idea if he&#8217;s a douche, but damn if the evidence isn&#8217;t overwhelming. If anyone would like to share (anonymously of course) why people hate him, we&#8217;re all ears: **tips@punchingkitty.com** or **314-266-TIPS**

Should be a fun Cardinals broadcast on Fox Sports Midwest tonight!
