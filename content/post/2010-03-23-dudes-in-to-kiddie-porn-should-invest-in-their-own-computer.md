I&#8217;m gross.&#8221;) is &#8220;Maybe I should invest in my own computer.&#8221;  Its clear these guys know there is a&#8230;lets just say &#8220;stigma&#8221; against those men with those interests, and one would think that the risk of being arrested, beat up, or even killed might be enough to pay the $300 dollars for some crappy laptop.

Well apparently times are tough all over, because dumb ass pervy guy there on the right thought the most cost effective solution was to go to the nearest library and check it out there&#8230;and then leave his filth ridden flash drive behind.

> Madison County officials said Lewis & Clark library security contacted its office after [Pervy McGee] returned to get a computer flash drive he left behind. Officials said while a library worker was verifying the flash drive belonged to [Mr Pervison], images of child pornography popped up on the computer screen. The library worker contacted the college security after [Fat Pervbert] denied ownership and went into the library. The Lewis and Clark Community College security called the Madison County Sheriff’s Office.

We wish we could have been there for this!

&#8220;Yeah, hi. I left my flash drive here.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh yes sir. We have a few flash drives right here. We just need to verify that this is your drive by checking the contents&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Um&#8230;ok.&#8221;

&#8220;Was your&#8217;s the drive with the photoshopped images of Dakota Fanning spread eagle on a bed?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah! Shit. I mean no&#8230;that stuff is icky.   &#8230;seriously though can I just take that and go?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call the cops.&#8221;

&#8220;Alright sir.&#8221;

Also of note: We&#8217;re happy to see its not always just skinny white guys getting arrested for kiddie porn. Diversity!
