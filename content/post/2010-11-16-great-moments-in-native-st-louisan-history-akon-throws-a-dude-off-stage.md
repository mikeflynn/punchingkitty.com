_St. Louis has a rich tradition of fine people hailing from our city, sloppy with &#8220;midwestern values&#8221; they move out in to other cities always carrying with them the badge of &#8220;St. Louis Native&#8221;. We don&#8217;t think some of these people get enough credit, so we, from time to time, will honor these fine individuals reaching for the stars._

_Today&#8217;s feature? Rapper and St. Louis native **Akon**._

It was over 3 years ago when perma-angry rapper and native St. Louisan (born in St. Louis, and raised in Dakar and Senegal), Akon took the stage at Dutchess Stadium. During a stirring monologue about culture, chicks and saying &#8220;you know&#8221; a bunch of times, a 15 year old kid threw something at Akon, who demanded the kid be pointed out so that a security guard could fetch him. Once brought on stage and the removal of his shirt and all jewelry, or &#8220;ice&#8221; as it&#8217;s sometimes called, Akon picked up the kid and threw him off stage, quickly returning to his soliloquy.

It made for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vygxmr8iKmA&t=0m23s" target="_blank">one hell of a YouTube video</a> and surely helped Akon keep his badboy rep, but the thing about tossing 15 year-old white kids is that what goes up, must come down&#8230;specifically he came down on Abby Rosa, giving her a concussion to take home from the concert.

This wasn&#8217;t the only Akon issue in 2007, he also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXW-ZEx_Kfs" target="_blank">dry-humped a girl on stage</a> that was later found to be 15.

Akon: One native St. Louisan that loves to touch 15 year olds.
