The &#8220;Partnership for Downtown St. Louis&#8221; released numbers that say the population of downtown St. Louis grew 3% in the last six months.

> Downtown residents grew from 11,997 as of Dec. 31 to 12,409 at the end of June, according to the report.
> 
> The survey includes information on all housing within the 2.95-square-mile downtown area, bounded roughly by Chouteau on the south, Cass Avenue on the north, the Mississippi River to the east and Jefferson Avenue to the west.
> 
> The growth at mid-year followed a 6 percent increase in 2008 from 2007. About 5,000 residents have moved downtown since 2000, according to the organizations.

Also of note is that they started counting homeless people&#8230;and benches.  Not sure if that caused the increase.  Probably not.  Eh, maybe.
