If we would have known that by mid Saturday we would be busy hiding from the heat, re-launching this blog, we would have made a point to grab our camera and head over to Pridefest.  But we didn&#8217;t.  We suck.

Luckily we live in an age where you don&#8217;t have to do anything to pretend  you are there, all you need is a few moments to do a Twitter or Flickr search!

We found a few great pics and videos via Twitter user [@Daethian][2]!  Here&#8217;s are personal favorite video:



Note the awesome &#8220;fourish&#8221; at the end of the flip.  Totally fabulous!

See all of Daethian&#8217;s pics and videos by heading to her blog, [Forever Purple][3]

We also found some amazing photos (like the one at the top of this post) from Flickr user kperfetto, in [her Pridefest photo set][4].

All the trappings of being there without having to actually leave the house!  We do promise to get over there next year though.

[Note: If you have any of your own photos, link to them in the comments or add them to the public news stream on the right.]
