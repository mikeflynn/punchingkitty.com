Earlier this week we took some time out of our day, pressed pause on our continual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Ezruu1oeQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mila Kunis British interview watching</a>, and <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/2013/03/04/quick-fixes-for-the-local-media-because-we-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the St. Louis media how to fix themselves</a>&#8230;and then we waited. Waited for the &#8220;Oh you think you&#8217;re so smart!&#8221; or &#8220;You deserve to get more than the usual amount of ass cancer!&#8221; emails/comments/tweets to come rolling in, but they never did. Instead we got things like this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2013/03/media_response_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15676" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2013/03/media_response_2.jpg?filter=resize&w=550" alt="media_response_2" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  and&#8230;

</p>

To these we say&#8230;get back in your seats, class is back in session.

#### Fox Sports Midwest

1. Stop hiring old Cardinals that weren&#8217;t all that good in the first place. No one&#8217;s getting lead in their pencil over seeing Ron Gant stumble through the teleprompter text, and then try to explain to &#8220;Buck from the Ozarks&#8221; why trading &#8220;Jamie Garcia to the Yankees for Robinson Cano and Phil Hughes&#8221; seems like a long shot.

2. Since we know you won&#8217;t do #2, at least don&#8217;t hire Aaron Miles.

3. Since we know you won&#8217;t do #3, make sure you buy a lot of stackable seat cushions for him to sit on. Try to keep a bag of Cheerio&#8217;s around to keep him from getting fussy between shots, and make sure you ask him about the times he pitched after every extra inning game. &#8220;Pappa Tony&#8221; said he likes that.

4. Tell &#8220;The Cat&#8221; (reporter Jim Hayes) that if we&#8217;re all supposed to keep playing along with his hair piece, lets at least switch it up a bit. Maybe one game come out with a <a href="http://beautyandthefeastblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/russell-brand-m01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell Brand-style</a>, and then maybe like a <a href="http://content9.flixster.com/photo/13/49/57/13495763_ori.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kid n Play look</a>. It would really spice up those early-August games vs the Marlins.

#### The Vital Voice

We know why The Vital Voice wanted to get on our list, and it&#8217;s because they know we love The Vital Voice! We know that you know that we know! &#8230;but also know this: We can always find something.

Why the hell do you have the weather on your home page? There is no point to that widget other than &#8220;Well, we already have three ads on the page!&#8221; guilt-based filler. Ditch the weather and just put another ad there, it&#8217;s ok because no one is checking the weather there ever ever ever (ever)!

> &#8220;I wonder if I should wear a coat today? I know! I&#8217;ll load up  thevitalvoice.com and scroll most of the way to the bottom and look at the right column for the most up-to-date weather information!&#8221;
>
> &#8211; No one, not even Dieta Pepsi

Maybe, _maybe_ we&#8217;d understand if you wanted the weather information just so you could tack on a standard &#8220;&#8230;with a slight chance of rainbows.&#8221; at the end of every day&#8217;s forecast, but failing that, it&#8217;s time to kill the weather.

#### InsideSTL.com

Though our audience has been known to overlap on a semi-regular basis, most of your content isn&#8217;t always in our wheelhouse. That being said, we&#8217;re certainly not going to begrudge you for that. Horny, sports-loving 18-year olds will always exist and as long as they click ads and come back each day it&#8217;s no doubt a solid business. There is one thing though: Lets call it a day on <a href="http://www.insidestl.com/tabid/105/default.aspx?albumid=1071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;Girl Next Door&#8221; bit</a>. There hasn&#8217;t been an actual hot girl on that for what appears to be from your archives, a very very long time. All your proving to us is that we live &#8220;next door&#8221; to a ton of chicks that look at least drunkenly bang-able with makeup, a tight girls Cardinals jersey and Photoshop. But we already knew that! We didn&#8217;t even have to see the girls to know because that list includes _every girl ever_ under 200 lbs and free of horrible physical deformity&#8230;well, at least under 250 and but no m deformities, like if they&#8217;re Philippine or something.
