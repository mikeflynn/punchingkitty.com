According to Mindy Kaling, aka The Office&#8217;s Kelly Kapoor, the St. Louis-raised girls of the office started up a little local-flavored bake-off on set:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9671" title="mindykaling_tweet" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/04/mindykaling_tweet.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="362" />][1]The three St. Louis raised stars of The Office who can apparently all make Gooey Butter Cake, are, of course, Jenna Fischer (Pam), who is hot, Ellie Kemper (Erin), <a href="http://bit.ly/fbZuSZ " target="_blank">who is also hot</a>, and Phyllis Smith (Phyllis) , <a href="http://bit.ly/eayejM " target="_blank">who also&#8230;um&#8230;works there</a>.

We asked Kaling for an update on the bake-off results, but as of this writing, we haven&#8217;t heard anything back. We will break in to whatever important thing you are doing later and tell you though since this is just as important as a tornado watch in the middle of Illinois and the weather people always busting in for that crap.
