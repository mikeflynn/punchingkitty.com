Don&#8217;t get excited, he won&#8217;t be playing.

> The St. Louis Rams traded with the San Francisco 49ers to acquire Bruce, the team announced today.  The Rams and Bruce will hold a news conference on Wednesday, June 9, at 12:30 p.m. in the Russell Training Center auditorium.
> 
> In his accomplished 16-year career, Bruce ranks fifth in the NFL with 1,024 career receptions, one of only six players in NFL history to have 1,000 career receptions.  He ranks second in the NFL with 15,208 career receiving yards.  His 91 career receiving touchdowns rank ninth in the league.

Ok. Cool and glad to see he cared enough to come back, even for a second, but the thing is&#8230;right now Bruce is like at least our 3rd best wide receiver. So&#8230;and we&#8217;re just throwing this out there&#8230;maybe don&#8217;t retire Isaac? Thoughts? I mean seriously.

Just something to think about. You won&#8217;t even be the oldest guy on the team&#8230;I hear the Rams are talking to Dan Dierdorf and this guy too who we&#8217;re pretty sure is dead.
