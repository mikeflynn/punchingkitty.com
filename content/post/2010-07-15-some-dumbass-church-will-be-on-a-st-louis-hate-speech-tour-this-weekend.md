Lady Gaga Proves That It Can Be Easy Being Green!" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/lady-gaga-muppet-marvelous2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="351" /></a>The socially retarded hate &#8220;church&#8221; that runs the site godhatesfags.com (no, they don&#8217;t get a link) will be in town Saturday, July 17th, to put up stupid signs and march around so everyone will look at them.

Here are snippets of their pubic itinerary:

> **2:00p &#8211; 2:30p @ Staenberg Family JCC**
> 
> You know how to read? Open a paper, or any website news page. I mean do you know that Egypt has made a law that any Egyptian man married to a Jewess shall lose their citizenship? Hello?! [&#8230;] You all have to be deaf, dumb and blind to not see what is happening on the national stage.

You would have to be lying to yourself if you don&#8217;t realize that if there are more than 60 people in your little protest group, that at least 2-4 of  you are actually gay. Stats don&#8217;t lie, just old white guys that hide their feelings until they have a few beers in them and the bus boy at the local Ponderosa walks by a little too close.

> **6:15p &#8211; 7:00p @ Busch Stadium**
> 
> Since you media types like to know precisely why WBC pickets at different locations; how does this work for you?: Missouri passed laws to stop the preaching of WBC, and each of you is individually guilty of that great sin.

Pfft. Oh yeah, like you&#8217;re the first person to tell us we are going to hell. Is that what you are saying? It sure _sounds_ like you are saying we are going to end our life in a overly warm place with lots of grouchy mean people in it&#8230;like Florida, but not real. We can live with that.

> **7:10p &#8211; 8:00p @ Scotttrade Center (Lady GaGa concert)**
> 
> Now what type of wicked hypocrites would we be if we did not warn this little false prophetess and all of her over-indulged sycophants that they are each one, individually heading straight to hell in a gender-confused, self-loathing, tone-deaf hand basket and that a gift from the God they hate? So, we made a couple of songs just for this event. You like Gaga&#8217;s songs? Here&#8217;s some lines from two of WBC&#8217;s parodies of them: Poker face, revamped as No Poker Face: &#8220;You wanna strut like you&#8217;re unique, but baby please &#8220;Monster,&#8221; &#8220;Lady GayGay,&#8221; &#8220;Show your teeth,&#8221; &#8220;This is all me.&#8221; (God hates you)

If you think a woman that walks around wearing stuff like above is going to be hurt when you call her &#8220;Lady GayGay&#8221; you got another thing coming. Plus &#8220;Lady GayGay&#8221; is so weak. Other hate groups are bullying on a 7th grade level, you guys are still stuck on calling people the equivalent of  &#8220;doodie heads&#8221;.

Hey perverted priests! _These_ are the people you should be raping.
