**Update:** See more posts on, what we&#8217;re calling, &#8220;Poopstock&#8221; <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/poopstock/" target="_blank">here</a>.

We&#8217;re hearing a lot of anger towards over-rated band Kings of Leon that was scheduled to appear at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater tonight but quickly canceled their own show after only three songs. The reason for stoping the show short? &#8220;Band safety&#8221; aka &#8220;F*ck you St. Louis Kings of Leon fans.&#8221;

So what&#8217;s the real story? We&#8217;re still trying to find out all the details, but one could piece a lot of the action together by following the chatter on Twitter:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5820" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/07/23/kings-of-leon-are-a-bunch-of-little-bitches/kingsofleon_show_tweets/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5820" title="kingsofleon_show_tweets" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/07/kingsofleon_show_tweets.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="429" /></a>Sounds like Kings of Leon had a serious case of Rock &#8220;star&#8221; sandy vagina. We&#8217;ll have more on this later.
