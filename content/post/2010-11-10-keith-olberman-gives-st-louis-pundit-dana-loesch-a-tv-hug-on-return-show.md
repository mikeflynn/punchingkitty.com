Not until the end of his show did Olberman really address his suspecition because of violating a NBC News policy for not previously seeking permission before making private campaign donations.

This clip below is a chunk of his statement on his suspension and subsequent rebirth from a trashcan fire no one was really all that worried about, right after he told everyone he did nothing wrong and right before he played a whole Daily Show segment&#8230;

Awwwwww&#8230;Olberman gives a little TV hug to St. Louisan Dana Loesch for being cool to him despite the fact that they&#8217;re both so different! Even admitting that she was &#8220;probably nicer to (him) that (he) would have treated them&#8221;. Nice to see a truce happen, even for a moment, with Mrs. Loesch, our town&#8217;s little enemy collector. Maybe this will spark a moment of clarity: Are you guys really so different? Crazy is crazy no matter if its for Coco Puffs, holding on to George W jokes way past their expiration date or tax cuts for super rich people. Can&#8217;t you see you love each other?!

Olberman also dropped this lovely technique in we just had to point out:

> &#8220;I like to name all of the 300,ooo signatories to that petition, but obviously I can&#8217;t, and anyway 99% were my relatives!&#8221;

LOL! ROFL! PMAL*! Really hilarious stuff. See if he makes this joke about how he had to have a petition filled with people that had to sign it, then he doesn&#8217;t look like a giant douche for saying 14 times that there was a petition of 300,000 signatures to get him back on the air.

Bad Self-Deprecation aka The Verbal Jingling of Keys. Well played sir.

* PMAL = Peed Myself A Little
