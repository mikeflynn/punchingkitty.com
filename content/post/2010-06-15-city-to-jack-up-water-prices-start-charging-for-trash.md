<a rel="attachment wp-att-5019" href="http://punchingkitty.com/2010/06/15/city-to-jack-up-water-prices-start-charging-for-trash/mayor_slay/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5019" title="mayor_slay" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2010/06/mayor_slay.jpg?filter=full" alt="" width="600" height="207" /></a>St. Louis is poor. Mayor Slay is about a month away from having city employees sell cheese and sausage to their families. If only there was another way! If the city could only fine a service they provide and then charge more for it&#8230;

> City residents can expect to see their water rates increase, and a new $144-per-family annual trash fee. The city also talked about charging a $10-per-person entry fee for recreation centers, though that precise number may not stick.

Now you&#8217;re thinking St. Louis! &#8230;an undisclosed water price increase and $12 a month for city trash pick up. Not great, but not horrible.

Other proposed changes that could help the city buy those new sneakers its been wanting are:

1. Fining the Â Rams for each loss next season.

2. A yearly $50 &#8220;No one broke in to my car&#8221; fee.

3. Metrolink is now a few of those two-man pump train carts from the cartoons.

4. Mayoral massages&#8230;ask about our _deluxe_ massage!

5. &#8220;Bribes are cool Wednesdays&#8221; at City Hall!
