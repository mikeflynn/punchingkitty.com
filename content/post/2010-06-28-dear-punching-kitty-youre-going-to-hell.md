**Subtitle:** _Dear guy: We know. It&#8217;s cool._

Sometimes people don&#8217;t like this site. It happens, and is expected. Whether it&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve made fun of them or they just don&#8217;t like our humor, its going to happen and that&#8217;s totally cool with us. No one is expected to like everything. For example, we don&#8217;t like Christian Rock. It&#8217;s horrible. That&#8217;s no sleight on anyone&#8217;s belief system mind you, just a preference, a preferences that drives us to not listen to Christian rock&#8230;it does not however make us want to write odd notes to the people that make Christian Rock. That would just be creepy and make us look like a retarded dick that has nothing better to do with this time.

&#8230;now guess where this is going.

Yup. We got a &#8220;crazy guy&#8221; note! No, not from <a href="http://punchingkitty.com/tag/charles-jaco/" target="_blank">him</a>, this one is from a new guy. Allow us to translate the comment/tip as posted on &#8220;[Classical Music Station 99.1 Finds Jesus][1]&#8220;:

> Here&#8217;s a tip for you&#8230;.

This is the big setup&#8230;its not going to be a tip at all!

> I just found your website.

I just found your website from a forwarded email that made me triple-click on the blue E to search Excite.com.

> Get a life.

I disagree with you so of course you are the one that should get a life, not me sitting at home angrily typing this email to someone I don&#8217;t know that talked about a radio station switching to christian music and really said nothing inflammatory at all.

> Are you on anti-psychotic medication? If not, you probably need to be.

See above.

> I am not afraid to post my email address but it does concern me that you might publish it and I am a very successful businessman and don&#8217;t need any grief from a loser like you who has committed the one and only sin that the Holy Bible says will &#8220;keep you out of Heaven for eternity.&#8221;

My name is Lawrence Moran, but even though I&#8217;m totally in the &#8220;right&#8221;, I won&#8217;t stand behind it with my name. I lie about what I do all the time, so sure, what the hell, today I&#8217;m a successful businessman! (<a href="http://richcrain.blogspot.com/2008/08/lawrence-j-moran-curriculum-vitae-study.html" target="_blank">see here about how Larry here is a liar</a>)

**Editor&#8217;s Note:** Larry, we went to Sunday school, and the &#8220;eternal sin&#8221; is committing suicide, which we have no plans to do&#8230;unless Megan Fox never does get back to us about our fan letter with that locket of hair we sent her.

> The reason I am giving you this tip is because after reading your hate on a few subjects, it is apparent that you have serious emotional issues. You may or may not already be aware of this disturbance which is based in your brain.

This &#8220;Dummies Guide to Crazy Email Writing&#8221; book is paying off huge right now!

> Again, I would love to publish my email address and name, however, you are not stable mentally and also choose not to publish your personal information so let&#8217;s just leave it at that.

My name is Lawrence Moran.

> Please&#8230;.take my free advice and shut this horrible mess down and change your life-direction. This is a horrible website. You are a sick person and this is a sick site.

&#8230;but I can&#8217;t stop reading it, thinking about it, or corresponding with it&#8217;s author.

> Please shut it down and leave your seriously misguided opinions between you and your psychiatrist.

I have no idea how to turn my computer off.

> If you don&#8217;t have one please find one. There are many wonderful practitioners in the metro area.

Dear Mr. President, there are too many states now a-days. Please eliminate three. Sincerely Grampa Simpson.

> Please&#8230;.shut this site down. For the peace of all on the local Internet.

The local internet is in unrest&#8230;only I can stop this&#8230;to my gmail account!

&#8212;&#8211;

Dear Larry,

Please chill out. We didn&#8217;t say anything bad about God, Jesus, Buddha, Vishnu or anyone else. We were just reporting that a station that was classical is now going christian rock. Seriously calm down&#8230;or don&#8217;t. Whatever. We just think it you might need to lower that blood pressure.

We understand if you don&#8217;t like the humor on this site. Maybe it&#8217;s not for you, just go somewhere else. No one is making you read it, and we&#8217;re going to have to gracefully pass on your offer for assistance with our afterlife reservations.
