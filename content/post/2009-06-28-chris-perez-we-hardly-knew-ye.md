Last night the Cardinals acquired the guy every one knew they wanted, Mark DeRosa, from the Cleveland Indians in exchange for &#8220;close of the future&#8221; Chris Perez and the always infamous &#8220;Player to be Named Later&#8221; (aka PTBNL).

For quick bites of analysis, we turn to Punching Kitty favorite Bernie Miklasz (via Twitter):

**Overall thoughts on the trade?**

[@miklasz:][2] I&#8217;ve been a DeRosa advocate so I love the move. His bat, versatility, ability to hit LH and clubhouse class make this a good deal.

[@miklasz:][3] The Cardinals dealt from surplus &#8211; they have a good supply of young RH relievers &#8211; so this does not weaken the present or near future.

[@miklasz][4]: The Cardinals also blocked teams who apparently coveted DeRosa including the Cubs Mets Braves and Giants to mention a few.

**[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-669" title="derosa" src="http://punchingkitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/derosa.jpg" alt="derosa" width="275" height="235" />][5]The Cardinals management finally added a guy for Tony who has been waiting for about 2 years now, he has to be pleased right?**

[@miklasz][6]: DeRosa is an ideal guy for La Russa who gets lots of mileage out of multiple position players.

[@miklasz][7]: LaRussa wanted to see ownership and mgmt be proactive and try to help the team win now. He will be pleased.

[@miklasz][8]: LaRussa and Duncan are big fans of Motte, not as much Perez. To me this trade also increases the likelihood that TLR will sign on again.

**&#8230;and about that PTBNL?**

[@miklasz][9]: I am pretty sure the quality of the player to be named later is tied into whether the Cardinals sign DeRosa to stay beyond this season.

**Lastly, what about those Matt Holiday rumors?**

[@miklasz][10]: Holliday ceased to be an option after Oakland would not come off a demand of a package that included last year&#8217;s No. 1 pick Brett Wallace.
