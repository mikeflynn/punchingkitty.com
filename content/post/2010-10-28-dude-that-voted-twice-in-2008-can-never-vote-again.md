The St. Louis man convicted of voting twice in the 2008 election was sentenced Wednesday to two years of probation, has to pay $350 in various fines, and oddly, sent to mandatory drug counseling.

Rumor is that, Tarrell Campbell, 34, opted for the drug counseling himself after realizing the folly of making a big effort to vote for President Obama _twice_, and get none of the &#8220;change&#8221; he broke the law for. Apparently half of a health care bill and a few stimulus bucks isn&#8217;t enough to keep Mr. Campbell on the Obama booze wagon!

We&#8217;re kidding! &#8230;it was like 4/7&#8217;s of a health care bill.

Another side effect of Campbell&#8217;s conviction is that he can never vote again because of his felony charge. It&#8217;s for the best, he was leaning towards wasting both of his votes on the Green Party this year.
