The Belleville police department&#8217;s switch board was lighting up yesterday, all from one woman who just really needed her beer back. Emergencies are subjective!

> Police say 36-year-old Shannon White dialed 911 several times on Saturday around 8:30 p.m. to complain her boyfriend would not allow her to drink more beer.
> 
> “Tonight he took away my beer and I want to drink some beer, and he took away my beer,” White said on one of the calls.

Shortly after 11p the calls stopped, but the BPD wasn&#8217;t done. They issued her a sommons to appear in court for disorderly conduct.

It&#8217;s easy to scoff, but we&#8217;ve all been there haven&#8217;t we? There&#8217;s been a time or two when you wanted to call 911 on a situation that might technically have been considered an &#8220;emergency&#8221;, it was plenty important to you, right? Lets share them! &#8230;ok, we&#8217;ll go first. You ever see something a think: &#8220;I wonder if our sexy parts would fit in there?&#8221; well we do and then shortly after we really really want to call 911. Not because we&#8217;re stuck or anything, just to tell them that we found something else it fits in. Someone should know, and they probably have something to write with.
