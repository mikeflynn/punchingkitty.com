George Clooney came to town and filmed it, and you probably know at least two people that made it as an extra (and about four others that tried) and now its finally getting close to hitting the big screens.

The Up In The Air trailer is here so now the world can see Lambert Airport in all its &#8230;um&#8230;glory!



&#8230;wait, this isn&#8217;t a movie about the worst airport ever that takes place in the 70&#8217;s?  God St. Louis must be cheap to film in.
