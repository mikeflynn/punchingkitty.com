> So I sent Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley an email and asked him when they planned on launching in St. Louis. He emailed me back almost immediately. He said that they were just a two man operation that was a little overwhelmed by the sudden popularity to Foursquare and they were scrambling to hire help to expand. He said that ideally they would like to launch in St. Louis in time for the start of the school year, but it seems more realistic that it won&#8217;t happen until the end of October or maybe later.

Awesome! Â Read the full post on [the Daily RFT][3].
