We found this video via <a href="http://www.thestlouisegotist.com/news/local/2010/july/26/god-bless-st-louis" target="_blank">The St. Louis Egotist</a> yesterday, and had to do the re-post. It&#8217;s really a very well done video with great shots of City Garden, City Museum, Forest Park, and all the other good places around town.

Notice how steady they keep the camera despite all the dead bodies and homeless people they had to step over to shoot it.
