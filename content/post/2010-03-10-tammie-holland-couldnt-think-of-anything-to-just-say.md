This KSDK &#8220;I&#8217;m Just Sayin'&#8221; thing is such a trainwreck I can&#8217;t help but not mention it just one more time here.  Why?  Because I finally remembered again that KSDK was doing this and found one I was looking forward the most on their site: Tammie Holland.

If you aren&#8217;t familiar, this is the spicy little vixen that had this crazy off the cuff conversation igniting statement in channel 5&#8217;s promos for the &#8220;I&#8217;m Just Sayin'&#8221; feature:

> Ladies here&#8217;s a tip. If you own one of these..
> 
> [points to her cellphone]
> 
> Keep your clothes on.

Oh man.  She did _not_ just go there.  I can&#8217;t wait to see the heat she brings in her full feature!

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/snNYL7WnCBc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

So you get your chance to be featured as the token black person a radio host on channel 5 and you bring the heat with &#8220;What&#8217;s with all the people selling girl scout cookies at work?&#8221;  What didn&#8217;t make the cut Tammie? Did you think of other burning topics like &#8220;How &#8217;bout this weather huh?&#8221; and &#8220;Geez.  Look at that guy.  No no, the other one. What&#8217;s that about?&#8221;

Then she pulls out the ole &#8220;Are we being too easy on our kids?&#8221; argument saying that schilling for cheese and sausage at work is making little Billy soft.  Yeah, I don&#8217;t think a sign up sheet taped to the outside of your cubicle is making Billy a pussy, that&#8217;s already been taken care of by the peanut allergy you assumed he had and the 6 ADD drugs you pump in him daily so he&#8217;ll just listen in class.

Well, we just don&#8217;t know how Tammie Holland does it, day in and day out, bringing up the tough topics. Don&#8217;t miss her exciting next KSDK turn where she throws around verbal blows like &#8220;Have you ever noticed how different guys are than girls?!  It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re from another planet!&#8221;

Oh man! Can&#8217;t wait!  Derp!
