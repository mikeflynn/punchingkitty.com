Sometimes you see a girl and there&#8217;s metaphoricalÂ sparks, other times there&#8217;s actual sparks.

> Hey baby, I&#8217;m sorry you had to see that, but you know I&#8217;m innocent girl. They ain&#8217;t put the receipt in the bag. Anyway, you were a stunning goddess, with more curves than a NASCAR track, and you seen it all go down. Drop a line for me, and I&#8217;ll show you that the whole ordeal left me electric. And no worries, they didn&#8217;t charge me with nothin but I can&#8217;t shop at the Gap with you anymore. Hope that ain&#8217;t a deal breaker.

We think this one&#8217;s just a little too good to be true, and might be, probably is, gotta be fake, but it&#8217;s entertaining! Also, this exact thing must have been actually said countless times in the St. Louis area, so it&#8217;s at least representative.
