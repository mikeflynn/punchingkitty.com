> &#8220;The choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not be based solely upon advertisement.&#8221;

You know, because if not, I was totally gonna.

Here&#8217;s how it would work if the law passes for each type of ad (from [STLToday.com][2] and the Missouri Board of Governers):

> **Print ads:** In a font in high contrast to the background at least one-third the size of the largest font displaying a telephone number, e-mail address, website or other contact info.

> **Radio or audio ads:** Spoken in a cadence not faster than the slowest statement of a telephone number or, in the absence of a telephone number, audibly in a clear and understandable manner.

> **Television ads:** The same as radio if spoken. If printed on the screen, in a font with high contrast to the background at least one-third the size of the largest font displaying the telephone number. If no telephone number, in a type size and manner that is reasonably legible for the duration of the advertisement or seven seconds, whichever is shorter.

How the hell did this become necessary?!  We&#8217;ve been to Wal-Mart, so we know that there is a large segment of people in Missouri that are in fact dumb enough to make this law needed, but how does a government figure that need out in the first place?  Did they poll the morons we are sending to prison at an alarming rate?

**Missouri:** &#8220;Hey Cletus, before we send your toothless ass to jail, can I ask you a question?  How did you go about picking your lawyer?&#8221;

**Meth Head:** &#8220;I saw&#8217;ed him on the Tee Vee!&#8221;

**Missouri**: &#8220;&#8230;and what?  That was it?  Anything else?&#8221;

**Methy McGee:** &#8220;Nope.  He shooo looked smart with that fancy suit and his eye patch!&#8221;

This law is for you Cletus.
