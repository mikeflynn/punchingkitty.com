[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8953" title="kyle_lohse_tattoo" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2011/02/kyle_lohse_tattoo.jpeg?filter=resize&w=250" alt="" />][1]Cardinals starting pitcher Kyle Lohse arrived at Spring Training the other day sporting some new ink.  Let us guess! Some sort of baseball that&#8217;s flying so fast the cover is coming off of it? Ding! Ding! Ding! How&#8217;d we guess?! Oh yeah, every pitcher that thinks tats are a good idea get something about a ball&#8217;s cover coming off. They must be big fans of The Sandlot or something.

> Lohse has a scar the length of his forearm curving from his elbow toward his wrist. He called it his &#8220;shark bite&#8221; last year. To draw attention away from the jagged fissure, Lohse enlisted the help of a tattoo artist who drew the intricate Koi fish and Zodiac tattoos that **Chris Carpenter** has on his leg and shoulder, respectively. Lohse gave him some ideas and this winter the artist went to work.

Ugh. Note to self: Chris Carpenter has the douchiest tattoo ever. We&#8217;re guessing the next phase of Carp&#8217;s ink is some sort of skeleton riding a Harley or maybe a Bald Eagle with something bitchin&#8217; clutched in his talons.

> Lohse said the baseball near his wrist is peeling away to reveal a globe underneath it. The purpose of the baseball shedding its hide is &#8220;to remind me there&#8217;s something else besides baseball.&#8221; The wings that sprout from the top of the baseball and run the length of his forearm to his elbow draws from a Native American inspiration for &#8220;power.&#8221; Lohse is a member of the Nomlaki tribe.

More symbolic of Lohse&#8217;s Cardinals years would have been a little baseball car with the wheels coming off, or maybe just the words &#8220;My best year was a contract year. Ca-ching!&#8221; &#8230;you could still put the &#8220;power wings&#8221; on there if you wanted.  We do love though when atletes like Lohse get something to &#8220;remind them that there&#8217;s more to life than baseball.&#8221; Seems a little extreme doesn&#8217;t it? Try reading a book maybe.
