> A truck lost a load of onions on I-55 just north of the 7th Street/Park exit, north of where [I-44 and I-55] merge south of downtown.
> 
> After clearing the onions themselves off to the shoulder, crews called in a street sweeper to clean up the juice left over after hundreds were run over by vehicles. Apparently onion juice is very slick.

So far, the Missouri truck drivers&#8217; plot to make a giant spilled-on-the-street sandwich in 2011 sounds delicious! Someone tell the cheese truck driver he has until August and the bread guy we need him to drive through around November.

We&#8217;re not trying to be picky, but if someone could hijack a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_pGT8Q_tjk" target="_blank">Grey Poupon</a> truck, we would really appreciate it. Totally makes the sandwich.
