&#8220;<a href="http://www.cleanthelou.com/" target="_blank">Clean the Lou</a>&#8221; 2010 is in our review mirror, but if you weren&#8217;t aware it was the first annual event of forming teams and cleaning up different areas of St. Louis.

> On Saturday, September 25, we held our very first Clean The Lou. More than 30 teams and many others across the metropolitan area worked tirelessly to clean up streets, alleys, parks and more. We made some great progress but there&#8217;s more to do.

The 2011 event is already set for October 1st, but if you feel like picking something up before then, it&#8217;s probably cool.

&#8230;except if you see a half-full can of Diet Mountain Dew at Union and Pershing in the Central West End. It&#8217;s ours. We promise to come back and finish it at some point.
