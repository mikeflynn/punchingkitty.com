Try the door.  Locked.

&#8220;Dammit. Figures!&#8221; you think to yourself.

It seems like an entirety passes.  You knock&#8230;nothing.

&#8220;What the hell?!&#8221;

The entire Quik Trip customer roster has turned over in the time you&#8217;ve been waiting here!  &#8230;wait!  Is there a girls restroom?   Shit.  Just the one.

More knocking.  Not that cute little tune you knocked the first time, but a more forceful, mean knock.

&#8220;Man, are you dead in there?!&#8221;

&#8230;

Actually?  Yeah.  He is.

> St. Louis police are investigating the death of a man found in a gas station restroom.
> 
> She said an investigation revealed that it appears to be a drug overdose.  An autopsy will be conducted to confirm that theory.
> 
> Officers said there were no signs of foul play.

&#8230;and that my friends is the first time someone has looked at a gas station bathroom and said nothing was &#8220;foul&#8221; about the situation.
