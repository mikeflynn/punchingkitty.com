If you are looking for a specific advertising opportunity with Punching Kitty.com, feel free to contact the editor by:

The audience we have cultivated here is a young, hip crowd, and we reach around 30,000 readers a month. The point here is to still deliver great content and allow a select few ads to shine and not be overrun with countless ads on the page, making us look like sell-outs and making your ad difficult to pick out of the crowd. If all the lower-levels are filled for a month, there will be a max of 5 different ads on a single page, but if you buy the space up, there could be as few as two. Throw in the fact that ads on Punching Kitty.com **start at only $20 a month** and its one of the best deals in St. Louis advertising!

### &#8220;Where will I see my ad?&#8221;

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5357" href="http://punchingkitty.com/?attachment_id=5357"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5357" title="Screen shot 2010-07-06 at 8.48.46 PM" src="http://media.punchingkitty.com/wordpress/2009/01/Screen-shot-2010-07-06-at-8.48.46-PM1.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="530" /></a>On the top right of the site, there is the featured ad place that can be broken up in to either 4, 2 or 1 ad slots, on the lower left on the homepage there is a tower ad.

Purchasing ads is done on a monthly basis and works in conjunction with the other advertisement orders we receive, with a focus on the larger request. So, if two people want half-size (300&#215;125) ad bars but someone comes in and requests the whole square (300&#215;250) we will notify the other advertisers of the opportunity to purchase the whole block, simply slide them back to the next month, or make other arrangements with other ad slots depending on availability.

**In addition to the display ad, there will also be a once-a-week post thanking our sponsors with information or links of your choosing.**

Below is a blank example of each of the available ad sizes along with their current price:

The 300 x 250, giving you the single ad in the top left featured spot!: $60/month

The lower left banner is a lot of ad-space for a little price! 118&#215;600 for just $20/month!
